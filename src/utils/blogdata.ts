<p>The hospitality landscape in Noida is about to witness a major shift. The Uttar Pradesh government has rolled out the Bed and Breakfast (BnB) and Homestay Policy 2025, bringing much-needed legitimacy and structure to guest accommodation facilities that have so far been operating informally.</p>
<p>
This landmark move opens new doors for property owners, offering not just legality but also financial incentives, promotional support, and training opportunities to help them thrive in the rapidly growing tourism sector.</p>

<h2>What the New Policy Means for Homeowners</h2>

<p>The policy creates a clear framework that distinguishes between homestays and BnBs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only legal property owners can apply. Leased or rented properties are not eligible.</li>
	<li>One certificate per building is allowed, covering up to six rooms or 12 beds.</li>
	<li>Caretakers permitted: In cases where the owner doesn’t live on-site, a caretaker can manage the facility.</li>
	<li>Mandatory registration: All applications must be submitted online at up-tourismportal.in, with approval granted within 30 days after verification and inspection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Categories, Fees, and Facility Standards</h2>

<p>To encourage participation, the policy offers a tiered classification system:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Silver Units</li>
	<li>Minimum 120 sq. ft. rooms</li>
	<li>Registration fee: ₹2,000</li>
	<li>Gold Units</li>
	<li>Must include AC, TV, fridge, geyser, and attached bathrooms (200 sq. ft. minimum room size)</li>
	<li>Registration fee: ₹3,000</li>
	<li>Dormitories/Homestays</li>
	<li>Fee: ₹100 per room</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, CCTV installation is mandatory, with recordings to be preserved for 90 days.</p>

<h2>Benefits Beyond Legality</h2>

<p>Officials highlight that the policy not only formalizes the sector but also supports homeowners with added income opportunities. Among the incentives:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Eligibility for subsidies under Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, helping property owners reduce power costs.</li>
	<li>Skill training for up to eight support staff members.</li>
	<li>Promotional visibility on the state’s tourism development portal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Suresh Raina, District Tourism Officer for Noida and Ghaziabad, remarked:</h2>

<p>“This is an excellent opportunity for residents to turn a portion of their homes into tourist-ready spaces. It not only provides income but also connects families with global travelers, bringing direct benefits from government training, concessions, and promotion.”</p>

<h2>A Welcome Move for the Hospitality Sector</h2>

<p>Industry leaders have welcomed the decision, noting that legalizing BnBs will enhance visitor trust while giving homeowners more financial stability. Vishesh Tyagi, President of the Paying Guest House Owners’ Welfare Association of Noida, commented that the move could unlock fresh opportunities, especially during international trade shows, exhibitions, and large-scale official events.</p>

<p>With well-regulated BnBs now set to operate legally, both homeowners and tourists stand to gain — homeowners from increased revenue and government incentives, and tourists from safe, verified, and comfortable stays.</p>

<h3>Final Word</h3>

<p>The BnB and Homestay Policy 2025 marks a turning point for Noida’s hospitality sector. By shifting informal guest accommodations into a regulated, incentive-driven framework, the government is not only fostering tourism growth but also empowering homeowners to become part of the city’s evolving travel ecosystem.<p>

<p>For homeowners in Noida, this is the perfect moment to explore hosting — legally, profitably, and sustainably.</p>

    <p>In today’s hyper-competitive hospitality landscape, hotels across the United States are seeking smarter, cost-effective, and results-driven ways to attract guests, increase bookings, and boost their digital presence. Surprisingly, many of these hotels are turning to Fielmente, a hospitality marketing agency based in India, to achieve their goals.

	<li>Leveraging Google Hotels & Meta ads</li>
	<li>Building brand visibility on social media</li>
	<li>Enhancing online reputation through reviews</li></ul>

  <p>For American hotels, this niche expertise is often more valuable than hiring a local generalist agency.</p>

  <h2>2. Cost-Effective Yet High-Impact Solutions</h2>

  <p>Hiring a marketing agency in the U.S. can be expensive, with high retainers and service fees. Fielmente offers world-class marketing solutions at a fraction of the cost, thanks to India’s skilled talent pool and lower operational expenses.</p>

<ul>

	<li>Influencer collaborations</li>
	<li>SEO and content marketing</li>
	<li>Advanced automation tools</li></ul>

      <p>All without compromising on quality.</p>


      <h2>3. 24/7 Global Reach</h2>

      <p>The time zone difference between India and the U.S. actually works to hotels’ advantage. With Fielmente’s team operating ahead of U.S. business hours, campaign execution, reporting, and optimization can be done overnight, ensuring faster turnaround times and continuous progress.</p>

⸻

    <h2>4. Proven Track Record With International Hotels</h2>

    <p>Fielmente has worked with resorts, boutique hotels, chains, and luxury properties worldwide, offering tailored marketing strategies that deliver measurable results. U.S. hotels gain from these tried-and-tested approaches without needing to reinvent the wheel.</p>



    <h2>5. Cutting-Edge Technology and Tools</h2>

    <p>Through Eazotel and other hospitality-focused tech solutions, Fielmente integrates:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>AI booking chatbots</li>
	    <li>WhatsApp & email automation</li>
	    <li>Channel manager integrations</li>
	    <li>Social media dashboards</li>
      </ul>
    <p>This technology-first approach ensures that hotels in the U.S. stay ahead of digital trends, offering guests a seamless booking experience.</p>


    <h2>6. Cultural Understanding of Global Travelers<h2>

    <p>India’s diverse hospitality market has prepared Fielmente to understand the preferences of varied guest demographics, from millennials to luxury seekers. This cultural adaptability enables the agency to design campaigns that resonate with both domestic U.S. travelers and international tourists.</p>


    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

    <p>For U.S. hotels, hiring Fielmente isn’t just about outsourcing marketing—it’s about gaining a strategic partner who combines industry expertise, cost efficiency, and global hospitality insights.</p>

    <p>At a time when attracting and retaining guests is more competitive than ever, Fielmente provides U.S. hotels with the tools, strategies, and creativity they need to thrive in a digital-first world.</p>

      hence, they are pivotal for your business and to respond

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Google reviews are necessary for any local business,</b> as
      73% of users search for online reviews, and consumers are
      twice as likely to search for new local businesses on
      Google.
    </p>
    <p>
      Replying to customers or customer feedback can be tricky,
      but it doesn’t have to be. This blog is to help you avoid
      common mistakes that could fuel negative word-of-mouth and
      make it difficult to attract new customers. Let us see how
      creatively you can reply to google reviews and facebook
      feedback.
    </p>
  
    <div>
      <h2>Why Are Reviews Important?</h2>
      <p>
        It is a legitimate question because the most formidable
        weapon against errors of every kind is reason! Reviews
        for any business are crucial for three main reasons, and
        let’s look at each one of them now.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The <b>first</b> is to get new customers. Every business needs
        new customers for growth and revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a scenario where a customer is looking for a
        cake shop to buy a cake, and he comes across two shops.
      </p>
      <p>Shop A has ten reviews with a 4.3 rating out of 5</p>
      <p>Shop B has six reviews with a 3.1 rating out of 5</p>
      <p>
        The person will probably choose Shop A as it has better
        Google reviews. He is among those 57% of consumers who
        only opt for businesses with a higher rating (4 or
        above).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have been avoiding reviews, this example should
        help you do otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that if your shop or business has fewer reviews,
        new customers might not even find your business in the
        first place. And you certainly DO NOT want that!
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Local SEO Guide, “The prominence of review
        isn’t particularly shocking, as it’s a way for Google to
        crowdsource ranking factors, it’s hard to spam, and the
        most problematic type of abuse is illegal.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The <b>second</b> reason is that reviews boost your business’s
        local SEO. You might already know Google’s proximity
        factor for filtering local search results. Good reviews
        are the factors that impact Google’s search results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s an easy example for you to understand. Imagine
        you are in a new city looking for the best store to buy
        a new dress. When you search in Google for the same, you
        will have options closest to you. But if a shop has
        better ratings than the one closest to you, Google will
        recommend that shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Managing your online reputation and brand visibility
        will help you reach potential customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are wondering why Google produces such results,
        the main reason is to provide the best results against
        your searches and reviews.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The <b>third</b> reason is that reviews are an opportunity to
        get better! Organizations usually conduct customer
        satisfaction surveys to know how customers feel about
        their products and services! Reviews are the same. You
        get positive, neutral, and negative comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        So engage with the reviews and take full advantage of
        the opportunity.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Why do we need to reply to Google reviews?</h2>
      <p>
        Google ranks those businesses that are reliable and
        trustworthy. As Google wants to provide the best result
        to a search query, it looks for quality also.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we respond to Google reviews, we help Google see us
        as a trustworthy place of business, boosting our
        credibility online and offline.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also greatly affects local SEO. So, if you have
        Google reviews, then make sure you reply to them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>How to Respond to Positive Google Reviews?</h2>
      <p>
        Positive reviews make you happy and keep you motivated.
        Customers love your business, and they tell their
        friends about it. So, you must acknowledge your
        delighted customers by replying to their positive
        feedback. The following ways will help you create that
        bond between your ‘happy’ customer and you.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Personalise the review:</h3>
      <p>
        When replying, personalise it using the person’s name,
        mention the product, and emphasise thanking them.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Timely response:</h3>
      <p>
        Respond quickly to the feedback if possible. The
        customer has gone out of their way to leave a review.
        Your responses promptly create a good impression and
        sense of acknowledgement for the customer.
      </p>
      <h3>3. State your happiness:</h3>
      <p>
        Construct your reply to show you are happy to help/serve
        them and appreciate them taking their time to share a
        review.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Match reviewers’ energy:</h3>
      <p>
        Try to respond in the same energy band as a customer.
        For example, if the customer has responded with
        enthusiasm, be sure to respond to him with great energy.

      <h2>How to Respond to Neutral Google Reviews</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        You can respond to neutral Google reviews as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        Acknowledge and thank the reviewer: I appreciate the
        customer’s taking the time to write a review.
        Acknowledge that you have seen the feedback.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>1. Emphasise:</h3>
      <p>
        Emphasise the valid points from the customer’s review.
        If they have a valid point or reason, assure them their
        changes will be done soon and take the necessary action
        to improve your product or service.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>2. Turn a Neutral review into a positive:</h3>

        then offer them a deal on the upgrade. Suggest other
        products or services to the customer that can prove to
        be better and an upgrade.

      <p>
        These are a few things to keep in mind while responding
        to negative feedback:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take your time for assessment:</li>
        <li>
          Do not panic, and take your time to understand and
          review the issue the customer faced.
        </li>
        <li>Check if it was your fault or not.</li>
        <li>Try to come up with a solution.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>1. Acknowledge and be apologetic:</h3>
      <p>
        Acknowledge the customer’s review. Apologies and let
        them know you have read the review, value your
        customers’ opinions, and apologies for their bad
        experience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>2. Ask for contact details:</h3>
      <p>
        Ask them for their contact details to share with

      <h2>
        Best Tips or strategies you should follow while replying
        to negative reviews
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Be polite and professional in your reply. Any impolite
          response will reflect negatively on your part.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid showing your emotions. It is not about how you
          are feeling. It is about your customer’s experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apologies to the customer, but only if it is
          necessary. Focus on the fact that your customer is not
          happy. Empathise with the customer and make them feel
          heard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure it is productive and restores faith in the
          customer’s mind. It will also show your potential
          customers your willingness to take action.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a customer has not mentioned the reason for their
          frustration, simply ask them but avoid taking guesses.
          Ask them to share their reason and try resolving it.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of fake reviews, please report them using the
          correct channels.

      <h2>How should we deal with fake reviews?</h2>
      <p>
        Fake reviews can seriously hurt your business
        reputation, whether good or bad. Some indicators used to
        find whether the reviews are fake or not are as follows:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>They are extremely positive or negative.</li>
        <li>
          The same way of phrasing a sentence can be seen
          throughout.
        </li>
        <li>
          They do not contain any details of the person’s
          product or service.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <p>
        In such cases, you can ask Google to review it; if the
        review goes against the guidelines, they will remove it
        for you. Also, remember to reply to the fake review. An
        example is shared below.
      </p>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hi, (Fake Customer Name),
        <br />
        We take these matters very seriously. Unfortunately, we
        have no record or recollection of your experience with
        us, nor can we verify anything about your identity from
        your name in our records.
        <br />
        We want to investigate further if you have done business
        with us. Please contact (Manager’s Name) immediately at
        (Email/Phone Number) so we can resolve this issue.

      <h2>Why do we need to reply to Facebook Feedback?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        While running a business on Facebook, you might consider
        taking your reviews seriously, as they greatly impact
        your presence on the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facebook reviews appear in your business page’s ‘Reviews
        or Recommendations section’. Compared to Google,
        Facebook can turn off the reviews, but it is recommended
        not to do it as reviews impact your potential customers,
        and it is one of the ways to establish your brand’s
        voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are running a Facebook business page, reviews
        are one of the ways of introducing and educating people
        on Facebook about your business. Managing the Facebook
        business page and working continuously to improve your
        overall public image is important.

      <p>
        As a business owner, reviewing and replying to reviews
        shared about your product or services is important.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Always address the customer by name to add a more
          personalised touch to your comment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Acknowledge the review and thank the customer for
          sharing their feedback. Rather than just writing
          ‘Thank you’, write a more personalised reply
          appreciating the customer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Quick replies play a major role as the customer goes
          out of their way to write and boost your public image.
          Always try to reply as quickly as possible. It makes
          customers feel wanted as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always try to retain the customers by welcoming them
          back soon. Try to do so by providing exclusive offers
          and discounts only for them.

        hospitality marketing solutions to hospitality
        businesses of all sizes.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most important reasons to have hospitality
        advisors is that they can help develop a strategic plan
        for your hotel that includes hospitality marketing
        solutions. The plan is achieved after a thorough
        understanding of your hotel’s strengths and weaknesses
        and the competitive landscape in your market.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good hospitality marketing agency will help you
        identify growth opportunities and develop strategies to
        achieve your business goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to their expertise in hospitality
        operations, hospitality advisors can also provide a
        valuable outside perspective. They can help you to
        identify areas where your hotel is falling short and
        develop solutions to improve your performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, having hospitality advisors can be a valuable
        investment for any hotel. With expert advice and
        guidance, hospitality advisors can help you improve the
        profitability and efficiency of your hotel and, in
        return, achieve your long-term business goals.

        Why is opening a cloud kitchen a good idea?
      </strong>
      <br />
      Here’s what happens exactly in a cloud kitchen model:
      Orders come in, meals are cooked, packed, and then whisked
      immediately to their delivery locations by the assigned
      fleet.
      <br />
      Why does this work?
      <b>
        Because you’re cutting costs on front-of-house
        activities and concentrating on your food.
      </b>
      With the availability of third-party services and the
      growing comfort of mobile ordering, this model seems just
      right to experiment with. There are more benefits involved
      like:
    </p>
  
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Lower real estate costs</h2>
      <p>
        Since you’re removing table servicing out of the
        equation and offering a delivery-only service, you’ll
        save a huge amount on real estate costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cloud kitchens release you from the obligation of having
        space in a high-visibility area. Rather than paying for
        accessibility, better-developed complexes, or even a
        large parking space, you can concentrate on having
        enough kitchen space in a decent area near your target
        market.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Better expansion opportunities</h2>

        The best thing about cloud kitchens is that you don’t
        need heavy investments to begin. You can start small but
        expand fast. Once you build a brand and get loyal
        customers, expanding to new localities and even new menu
        varieties gets easier. Let’s take the example of Faasos,
        today it runs 160+ kitchens and 4 brands including
        Faasos, Behrouz Biryani, Oven Story, and Firangi Bake.

      <h3>Saving on overhead costs</h3>
      <p>
        With a cloud kitchen, you save so much on overhead
        costs. You don’t need client-facing staff, decoration or
        space entrance, parking area, etc. Even if you have
        lower-priced menu items, your profit margins are likely
        to be better.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h3>How does a cloud kitchen work?</h3>
      <p>
        Cloud kitchens are centralized licensed commercial food
        production facilities where anywhere from one or two to
        dozens of restaurants rent space to prepare
        delivery-optimized menu items. One restaurant may run
        multiple brands or virtual restaurants, all operating
        under one roof, or the kitchen may be run like an
        incubator, shared by different purveyors. Picture a
        large warehouse with numerous stations
        (mini-restaurants) of stainless steel prep tables, hood
        vents, stoves, ovens, and sinks, each with its own
        orders coming in directly from customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cloud kitchen menu items are optimized for ease of
        production and reliability of food quality upon
        delivery. Often physically located in out-of-town
        industrial complexes, cloud kitchens may offer driver
        parking, driver waiting areas (often with screens to
        monitor order times), and check-in stations for seamless
        driver pick-up. All are designed to get food out the
        door and into the customer’s hands as fast as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cloud kitchens are uniquely tech-enabled. They take
        advantage of the now ubiquitous food delivery apps on
        your smartphone, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub, and
        Doordash.
        <br /> In doing so, they use large amounts of data to
        determine what types of foods to produce for specific
        neighborhoods and when the demand is likely to be
        greatest. For example, hot wings tend to be really
        popular between 11 pm-2 am near college campuses. This
        data is fueling rapid adaptation and optimization,
        almost in real time.
        <br /> As the technology has matured, additional
        services have emerged to aggregate the various delivery
        apps into one portal, for easier production of multiple
        orders and delivery coordination as well as smart food
        purchasing and production software for decreased food
        waste and increased per-meal unit economics. We have
        only seen the tip of the iceberg of innovation in this
        space.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Competing in a crowded digital marketplace</h2>
      <p>
        With no physical location, cloud kitchens don’t benefit
        from walk-in traffic. You are competing exclusively in a
        crowded online marketplace. The good news is, if your
        product is good enough, it should rise to the top thanks
        to social proof like good reviews and word-of-mouth
        referrals. But you may find yourself having to pay for
        visibility on these platforms. That is, after all, how
        they make their money. You should be aware of this
        potential added cost, especially at the beginning,
        before you’re able to develop your own loyal following.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Food quality and food safety</h2>
      <p>
        With a delivery-only brand, your reputation relies on
        the food getting to the customer in perfect condition.
        Getting this right is the only way to get repeat orders.
        There are significant challenges in keeping the product
        at proper temperatures so it arrives as intended to the
        customer. Not just at the right temperature for them to
        best enjoy it but also to ensure it is safe to eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means testing out different types of packaging and
        potentially investing in containers that are more
        expensive and harder to source. This is a cost that can
        quickly add up when you are pumping out a high volume of
        orders, but it is a vital consideration. Soggy, lukewarm
        food will guarantee failure. And one food-borne illness
        or outbreak and your brand is toast.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Local regulation and licensure</h2>
      <p>
        Food production is largely regulated at the local level
        by your health department. Since cloud kitchens are so
        new, regulators may be unfamiliar with the concept. They
        may start hitting you with unexpected requirements, or
        start treating you like a full-service restaurant.
        <br />
        Agents will want to see that food is being safely
        stored, produced, packaged, and delivered, which may
        require the production of <b>HACCP</b> and other
        production plans for review. Also, having multiple
        tenants producing under one roof increases the
        complexity of who is licensed to produce and distribute
        food. You must be prepared to go the extra mile in
        showing them that your operation is safe and
        responsible.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>What’s behind the cloud kitchen trend?</h2>
      <p>
        Cloud kitchens started popping up in the early 2010s in
        response to increased demand for high-quality meal
        delivery and rising rents in city center locations.
        Green Summit Group opened one of the first cloud
        kitchens in New York City in 2013, and has grown out to
        four locations across two cities.
        <br /> Many more start-ups have followed suit and as we
        enter a new decade, cloud kitchens are becoming big
        business, with venture capital pouring into start-ups
        specifically aiming to take advantage of this new
        market.
        <br /> The trend is driven by the coming of age of
        millennials with disposable income demanding digital,
        mobile-friendly solutions. And this will only get more
        pronounced as the next generation, who have grown up
        with the internet and smartphones, enters the
        marketplace (sorry boomers). Looking further forward
        advances in kitchen automation, drone delivery, and the
        continued growth of the gig economy look to give cloud
        kitchens more of an advantage by lowering their costs
        even further.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Let’s take a closer look at the factors affecting the
          trend.
        </li>
        <li>Real estate prices in urban areas</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        As urban real estate prices continue their upward trend,
        delivery-only kitchens are able to take advantage of
        their ‘virtual’ nature. The only restriction on their
        location is that they must be within a realistic
        delivery distance of enough hungry customers.
        <br /> Companies like Kitchen United are focussing on
        light industrial areas outside dense urban centers but
        near enough to satisfy the demand of residential areas.
        Large warehouses at low rents are the perfect venues to
        house expansive shared kitchens if you have the capital
        to outfit them. Using demand data collected from
        delivery apps, they are able to determine the best
        locations to serve particular neighborhoods.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Increase in demand for delivery</h2>
      <p>
        Food delivery is set to grow to a $200 billion industry
        by 2025, due to shifting changes in behavior, with
        nearly half of consumers preferring to eat at home. Uber
        is even more optimistic than most, valuing the market at
        $795 billion.
        <br /> With 91 million monthly users, Uber Eats is
        currently the most popular food delivery app. Consumers
        are increasingly willing to pay a significant amount for
        the convenience of having their food delivered.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Increase in on-demand contract workers</h2>
      <p>
        With the gig or sharing economy in full swing and
        expected to hit $335 billion by 2025, we’ve seen an
        increase in on-demand contract workers. The number of
        people working as ride-share drivers, delivery drivers,
        and remote workers is on the rise, offering low-cost
        labor with no strings attached from an employer’s point
        of view. However the stability of the gig economy is
        still unknown. California recently passed a law that
        requires that some companies treat contract workers as
        employees.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>
        Emerging technologies decrease the cost of delivery
      </h2>
      <p>
        Looking further forward, drone delivery and kitchen
        automation are set to disrupt the standard restaurant
        model further. Robot kitchens are on the rise and drone
        delivery is poised to break through, with only regional
        regulations standing in its way.
        <br /> Tech-minded shared kitchens are perfectly
        positioned to take advantage of these advances. They are
        much more able and likely to adapt quickly to new
        technology, giving them a further edge over storefront
        restaurants.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Access to user data and real-time adaptability</h2>
      <p>
        Because they are designed with tech in mind, cloud
        kitchens can optimize processes, ordering, and staff
        scheduling based on consumer behavior. The menu can also
        be adapted to suit demand and increase margins,
        optimizing the model over time.
        <br /> Not being tied to a physical location means you
        can change the menu or operating times to suit business
        needs without as much of an impact on customer
        satisfaction. This can also help to decrease food waste,
        as you can be smarter with ordering and prep decisions.
        <br /> In fact, virtual restaurants are so adaptable,
        you can even launch a brand just for a season. For
        instance, you could launch a healthy salad brand for the
        summer and a hearty poutine concept for the winter
        months, allowing you to take advantage of the seasonal
        demand for each type of food without enduring any
        downturn.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>
        Digital brand awareness without high marketing spend
      </h2>
      <p>
        Virtual restaurant brands can gain quick exposure
        through delivery apps, rather than having to market
        themselves. Although a new virtual restaurant concept
        will have to pay for visibility, which is part of the
        delivery app business model, this can still work out
        cheaper overall, especially if you are creative about
        building your brand.

    <div>
      <h2>
        What are the potential challenges with ghost kitchens?
      </h2>
      <p>
        With any new technology, there are going to be certain
        drawbacks along with the benefits. Here are some of the
        potential challenges that come with running a cloud
        kitchen.
        <br /> Working with on-demand staff running a cloud
        kitchen, you may be more inclined to hire on-demand
        staff to control margins. While this can save on your
        wage bill, it comes with some caveats. Since staff won’t
        be interacting with guests or getting tips, it could
        feel more like working in a factory than a hospitality
        job. Of course, you can try to boost morale and motivate
        staff in other ways, but it may be more difficult to
        build a brand culture if you are not attracting the top
        food service talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hiring on-demand staff also carries risks in terms of
        food safety and consistency, both vital to successful
        food businesses. Can you be sure these workers have
        adequate training? If you want to invest in training, it
        makes more sense to hire permanent staff members. There
        is a trade-off here that you will have to work on to try
        to figure out the best balance between on-demand workers
        and permanent staff.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Reliance on third-party delivery apps</h2>
      <p>
        For all the benefits of using delivery apps, it’s never
        a good business decision to rely on one source of
        customers. The high fees can also eat into your margins
        and you have little control over last-mile delivery
        which can affect the quality of the food and put your
        reputation at risk. One way to counter this is to offer
        your own delivery service, but this comes with higher
        marketing costs and logistical complications.

        All You Need To Know About How To Open A Cloud Kitchen
        In India
      </h2>
      <p>
        In this article, we will take you through the
        investments, licenses required, type of location, and
        everything else you need to know about how to open your
        very own cloud kitchen.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        1. Deciding The Location Of The Cloud Kitchen Restaurant
      </h3>
      <p>
        The primary reason behind the low investment needed to
        open a cloud kitchen is the real estate cost. Location
        is the biggest differentiator that reduces the cost of
        opening a cloud kitchen as compared to a traditional
        dine-in restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          In the cloud kitchen model, the location doesn’t have
          to do anything with footfalls, parking space, and
          high-end sites. However, it does have a lot to do with
          proper sanitation and water supply with low rentals.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the location should be chosen based on the
        customer demography and the type of food product that
        you are selling. The cloud kitchen should be located
        where there is a high demand for the food that you’d be
        offering. For instance
        <br /> This article will tell you how to decide the best
        location for opening your cloud kitchen business.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>2. Implementing The Online Food Ordering</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have decided on the location, you need to
        decide on the technology to accept orders. There are
        many online ordering and delivery platforms such as
        Swiggy, Zomato, Foodpanda, etc. that accept online
        orders on your behalf and also deliver the food to your
        customers. These companies usually charge 18-30% of your
        revenue per order. There is also a one-time integration
        fee involved for some FoodTech companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          Since a cloud kitchen relies solely on its online
          presence to draw in customers, a website with the
          option to order food online is an absolute must.
        </b>
        Various website developers can build a well-optimized
        website for you. However, you can also go for the
        services provided at POSist, which also gets integrated
        with your POS software, which further increases your
        efficiency in taking orders and managing customers.
        Also, customers can track their orders on a real-time
        basis.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>3. Acquiring The Licenses For The Online Kitchens</h3>
      <p>
        Licensing is an integral part of setting up a
        restaurant. Few licenses are essential to procure in the
        first month of operations for a hassle-free business.
        <b>
          These are FSSAI licenses, GST Registration, Municipal
          health trade licenses, fire licenses, etc.
        </b>
        It is advised to hire an agency to apply for all the
        permits because it is the most tedious and
        time-consuming task. Apart from this rest of the permits
        would cost you around Rs 10,000 (if the FSSAI license is
        applied for one year) Here is a complete list of all the
        permissions required for opening a food business in
        India and the steps to procuring them.
      </p>

      <h3>
        4. Kitchen Equipment, Raw Materials, And Packaging
        Needed For A Cloud Kitchen
      </h3>
      <p>
        The cost of setting up the kitchen will vary depending
        on the cuisine and food you are offering. For example,
        the cost of setting up a cloud kitchen that wants to
        serve items like Burger, Pizza, Pasta, and Sandwiches
        will not cost more than Rs 2,00,000.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>
          If you spend wisely on equipment by procuring new
          electronic items and old equipment such as tables,
          racks, and storing shelves, you can save up a lot of
          money.
        </b>
        The cost can go up because of the heavy equipment like a
        chimney, deep refrigerators, and burners. If you are
        planning to run multiple brands from the same kitchen,
        you can leverage the same kitchen equipment and
        resources for multiple brands. This would help you save
        on the equipment cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is how you can choose the kitchen equipment for
        your cloud kitchen
      </p>
      <p>
        Raw materials required to start the cloud kitchen
        operations depend on the type of food you’re offering.
        It is important to choose the right vendors at this
        stage for the raw materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should allocate an extra budget for packaging as it
        plays a crucial role in creating a brand recall for the
        customers. The packaging must be sturdy to preserve the
        quality of the food during the delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since you are no longer able to provide a physical guest
        experience, packaging should leave a good impression on
        the minds of the customers. Ensure that the packaging
        contains your restaurant’s logo and reflects the theme
        and concept of your restaurant.

        5. Staff Requirement In A Cloud Kitchen Restaurant
      </h3>
      <p>
        The secret sauce behind a successful restaurant is the
        team that works for it, with the Chef being the most
        critical part of the team, as they not only prepare the
        food but also help in designing the menu.
        <b>
          In an online kitchen, a minimum of five employees is
          required.
        </b>
        You’d need at least two chefs, two helpers, and one
        housekeeper. The salary of the staff depends on their
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average salary of the Chef at Commis level 1 is Rs
        14000- Rs 15000, while that of helpers and other staff
        salary ranges between Rs 6000- Rs 8000 based on their
        work. Apart from the kitchen staff, two employees at the
        delivery and one at the counter for receiving online and
        telephonic orders are required. Here we would also like
        to recommend you to partner with the third-party
        delivery services which work on a per-order basis.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>6. Staff Uniform For Cloud Kitchen Employees</h3>
      <p>
        For a cloud kitchen, one may feel that a staff uniform
        is not required. However, it is still heavily
        recommended to have a dress code for maintaining
        discipline, cleanliness, and hygiene.
        <b>
          Also, provide your cloud kitchen staff with essential
          hygiene and safety standards equipment such as masks,
          hair caps, and gloves.
        </b>
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        7. Point Of Sale Technology Needed For A Cloud Kitchen
      </h3>
      <p>
        The entire online food ordering and delivery system is
        heavily dependent on the proper acceptance of food
        orders.
        <b>
          It is also essential to keep track of the number of
          orders incoming from the various online ordering
          platforms. Tracking of orders and detailed reporting
          is essential for the smooth functioning of
          restaurants.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Select a POS that is customized to suit the requirements
        of the online ordering website. The one we recommend is
        our very own POSist software, which is
        hardware-independent and completely browser-based. You
        can use any web-enabled device such as a computer,
        laptop, tablet, or even your mobile to generate the
        bills.

          An online kitchen requires a board line, mobile

        Apart from that, you can also get a Cloud Telephony

      <h3>9. Marketing Required For A Cloud Kitchen</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="/industries-we-serve/cloud-kitchen-marketing-agency/">Proper marketing and advertising</a> are
        essential to the success of a restaurant. For a cloud
        kitchen, marketing becomes even more necessary as it
        becomes the single source of getting orders. Since you
        are not spending on location and other maintenance
        costs, you can keep a sum aside for marketing.
        <b>
          Online marketing works in favor of cloud kitchens
          quite well.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing you need to do is to get your restaurant
        registered on restaurant listing and review sites such
        as Zomato, Tripadvisor, Burrp, etc., and encourage
        positive reviews from your regulars. You can also try
        Facebook for advertising exclusive deals and discounts.

      A website is a must if you own a restaurant and want to
      create a digital identity for your business. A website is
      important to interact with customers and attract potential
      customers through the website. Therefore, the website for
      any restaurant needs to be interactive. However, there are
      so many different website platforms that it becomes
      difficult to choose a feature-rich platform that provides

      platforms for a restaurant website is HTML and WordPress,
      and people are usually confused between the two. Both
      types of websites have their advantage, but which is best
      for a restaurant? Let’s find out.
    </p>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Restaurant website based on HTML</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is one of the most basic ways to create a website,
        but it can be customized to your favorite design through
        CSS. A restaurant website based on HTML will come with
        the most simple-to-use user interface, where you can
        easily provide textual, video, and image forms of
        information to the viewers. If you want your customers
        to open the website and other pages on it with speed,
        then HTML is the best option. You can provide the
        details of your restaurant, images of the recipes, pages
        to introduce your team, and more.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />

      <h2>Pros</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to use and navigate for users</li>
        <li>
          Can easily integrate images, video, and text to show
          and describe various recipes and dishes
        </li>
        <li>
          Requires fewer server resources, so your website will
          open faster and will be up almost every time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Takes less time to develop, and the cost of creating
          an HTML website for a restaurant would less.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Cons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lack of many features like social media integration,
          animation, themes, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides a basic website that does not create an
          interactive experience for any restaurant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Does not allow a blogging engine, where the restaurant
          owner can easily interact with customers for feedback
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Restaurant website based on WordPress</h2>
      <p>
        WordPress is one of the most popular website platforms
        and is being used by some of the most popular
        restaurants in the world, such as Chez Panisse and
        Gotham Bar & Grill. With a WordPress website, you can do
        almost anything, limited only by the imagination of the
        restaurant owner. It is very easy to use and provides
        many features that increase the interaction with the
        potential customers of your

      <h2>Pros</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Restaurant owners can easily use tools and add things
          to websites like post press releases, announcements,
          or events immediately. Formatting and editing on a
          WordPress website are much easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is faster and includes all the features of HTML
          with additional website-building tools of WordPress.
          It makes it easier to design the website.
        </li>
        <li>
          It can add maps and directions to the website, making
          it easier for customers to locate the restaurant.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can integrate the social media components to
          interact with the customer online and in real-time.
        </li>
        <li>
          It also provides a reservation engine, which can be
          used to make reservations for restaurant tables
          online.
        </li>
        <li>
          Menus listed on the WordPress website can be easily
          edited and downloaded on users’ systems or phones.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is SEO optimized, so promoting your restaurant

        <li>
          The cost of creating a WordPress website is more

      <h2>Verdict</h2>
      <p>
        If you own a restaurant, a WordPress website makes a lot
        more sense as it allows you to interact with customers
        in multiple ways and guide them to your restaurant.
        Additionally, new plugins and features are regularly
        added to the platform, which helps to make the

      <h2>
        Why do you need a brand guide for hotels and
        restaurants?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Each business is different, but each requires a brand
        identity and image so that people can identify it across
        all channels, both physically and digitally. When we
        speak of the hotel industry, a brand guide plays a
        quintessential role in making your hotel different and
        appealing to tourists, visitors, and potential customers
        than others. If you don’t follow certain brand
        guidelines you will never be able to make a lasting
        impression in the market, nobody will recognize you, and
        nobody will remember it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>
        Let us understand the components of a brand guide with
        examples:
      </h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Brand voice</h2>
      <p>
        Brand voice is the message that the brand wants to
        deliver and establish in the market, especially in the
        eyes of the customers. A good example of a changing
        brand voice came from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company in
        2015 when they revealed a new logo and brand voice and
        promoted it across all channels to meet their guests.
        They made this change after 32 years.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <p>
        Take the example of any brand that you come across, you
        will find that there is a certain font, a type of
        structure they are following that not only makes them
        stand out from others but, at the same time, it offers
        them a new identity so much so that people instantly
        relate to a certain brand. You won’t believe it, but
        that’s how much the typography of a brand has ingrained
        into our minds.
        <br /> For example, to understand the logo and
        typography, let’s consider Park Hyatt, a sub-brand of
        the Hyatt Hotel Group. The typography is sleek and at
        the same time, it restores elegance in it. They use the
        serif font and the use of lines replicates strength.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Colour palette</h2>
      <p>
        When I say red you can immediately think of Zomato, when
        I say Swiggy you have an orange colour logo forming in
        your head, but it’s not even a typical orange but
        somewhere between red and yellow. Have you ever come
        across a brand that has multiple colour usage in its
        design, symbols, and logos? Go on, take a minute, think
        about it –<br /> You may not be able to think of any
        brand after I gave you the example of single-color
        brands, but actually, there are many, do you know what
        separates them? They are following a colour palette.
        <br /> Let alone if we Take the example of hotels, let’s
        talk about the Plaza Hotel in New York City, It has been
        a prominent location for many film shoots, The Plaza
        uses pink and its shades to add a touch of sweetness,
        and the hotel is known to use every shade of pink to
        replicate a feeling and spark a vibe for their guests.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Imagery</h2>
      <p>
        Pay attention, here we are not talking about a single
        picture that speaks for the brand, but all the visuals
        that come together to create brand imagery in a variety
        of ways. Now, these images can be used in multiple
        channels, from billboards to Instagram, in print ads on
        websites as well.
        <br /> When you are a hotel brand, such pictures can
        trigger your customers or a tourist to remember you and
        make a mental note of it, so the next time they are
        booking a hotel they will remember you. Remember, these
        are not random pictures but convey an emotion, most
        importantly the brand values. Many hotels use
        single-colour imagery because it retains sophistication
        and directly speaks to the eyes of potential customers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Tonality</h2>
      <p>
        Every hotel has a distinctive personality, for example,
        if you have to describe your hotel to a stranger for the
        first time, how will you do it? It is often suggested in
        hotel branding, that the owners must avoid using jargon
        and buzzwords.
        <br /> Your hotel’s persona should bring a specific
        image to mind. Having clarity can help you create good
        marketing creatives and copies, but not only that, it
        resembles one of the main brand guidelines.
        <br /> A subtle example of this would be the Aman –
        Luxury hotel, The hotel brand maximize the use of
        graphic images and only uses simple snippets but
        on-point information text, and again it is beautiful in
        its own way. The design sets the tone of the entire
        hotel chain.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Brand Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Like every individual has their way of doing things,
        this same formula applies to hotels and most importantly
        brands. So why certain brands do something and why they
        do it in a certain way replicates the brand philosophy,
        and that’s a pivotal part of the brand guide. People
        visiting your hotel must believe in its philosophy of
        doing things and how it caters to its customers.
        <br /> Another good example comes from the Ritz-Carlton
        hotels making an art form of guest service. They stated
        that a great service philosophy always empowers
        employees to demonstrate a higher degree of trust and
        work toward guest satisfaction.
        <br /> At last, we can easily conclude that a brand
        guide is a significant tool in marketing. If you are a
        hotel owner and also struggling to set brand guidelines
        to create an identity. Fielmente as a digital marketing
        agency specializing in the hotel industry will help you
        formulate your entire brand identity and create the most
        amazing brand guide which will not only appeal to your

  <p>As digital marketing is shifting rapidly, your hotel must use the best marketing concepts to drive new
    business. Online marketing through SEO, content, social media, paid campaigns, chatbots, and reputation management
    could greatly impact your hotel business. Oh, wait! Your website’s user experience is also important. But, don’t
    worry, Fielmente is here.</p>
  <p>To help you take your restaurant to the next level, we’ve suggested some creative ideas that would require little or
    no budget.</p>
  <p><b>Do a Q&A session with an industry expert at your hotel to drive marketing results.</b></p>
  <p>Create a Q&A or a podcast with an industry expert with a big social following. After the interview, post their
    responses on your social media, company’s blog, or newsletters.</p>
  <p>This type of content marketing works because the experts you interview might act as a brand preachers and bring
  their audience to you. Also, you can conduct live YouTube sessions and ask the audience to submit their questions for
  better engagement.</p>
  
  <br />
  <h2>Optimize your hotel’s website for voice search.</h2>
  <p>Event Planners and potential clients increasingly use voice search to get quick answers. So when you ask, “ Hey Siri,
    how many rooms are in the XYZ Hotel?” you need to make sure Siri knows the answer.</p>
  <p>But how?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Customize your SEO strategy and content so that modern speakers can easily tell the answers.</li>
    <li>Make the FAQs on your website as clear as possible so that search engines can find the answers properly.</li>
    <li>Find out the keywords your target consumers are searching for.</li>
    <li>Use alternative tags and descriptions on your images and all parts of your website to permit easy scanning and to
      occur through voice search.</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <h2>Create hotel ambassadors.</h2>
  
  <p>Sometimes a simple marketing idea for hotels comes from a simple hack. So reach out to your hotel employees and get
    this strategy done.</p>
  <p><b>Let them post on social media.</b></p>
  <p>Choose an in-house ambassador to reach people, interact with potential customers, and share unique thoughts about
    your
    business. This will help solidify the brand value more. These optimistic brand messages on social media will help
    build
    a well-known and respectable image.</p>
  <br />
  <h2>Create “blesuire” experiences at your hotel</h2>
  <p>What’s that? – Business + Leisure. Remember that event planners need to have meetings for business events, and your
    hotel’s services can help them achieve that.</p>
  <p>These days, travelers seek remarkable local experiences while on their business trips. Business travelers look
    forward
    to hotels that can host the program and offer special services like a gym, spa, sporting activities, social happy
    hours,
    and other luxuries. A taste of regional culture, great food, and eye-catching sights don’t hurt either.</p>
  <br />
  <h3>Offer upgrades to business travelers.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Extravagance amenities</li>
    <li>Free ride to a major convention</li>
    <li>A free beverage at the hotel bar or restaurant</li>
    <li>Tickets to reservations at high-end restaurants</li>
    <li>Access to a local music venue</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>An add-on or upgrade can close the deal for guests. Weave in tailored add-ons like these when clients go to
    book:</p>
  <br />
  <h2>Post testimonials and reviews on your hotel’s website.</h2>
  <p>Your possible clients will read the feedback no matter what, so you might as well place them on your social
    media! You can ask past guests for custom reviews, or you can take the quotes from review sites like
    TripAdvisor.</p>

    <h2>2. Create an Objective Statement for Yourself</h2>
    <p>Every marketing plan should have a clear objective that is specific, measurable, and achievable. Once you conduct a
      SWOT analysis and identify the areas where you need to make improvements in your business, create an objective
      statement for yourself.</p>
    <p>For example, your company is planning to roll out a new range of products by 2022. Your objective statement could
      be: “To launch a new range of products to increase the revenue from this segment by 30% in 2022”.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>3. Develop a Target Audience Profile</h2>
    <p>A lot of work goes into developing a target audience profile. The reason behind developing a target audience
      profile is to ensure that your marketing strategy is successful, and you are able to target the right audience for
      each product or service that you develop in the future.</p>
    <p>A target audience profile can be developed in many ways. One way is to look at the characteristics of a person who
      bought a product or service in the past and find out if they are likely to buy that product or service again.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>4. Determine the Market Share For Each Product or Service</h2>
    <p>Determine the market share for each of your products or services so that you have a true indication of the sales
      potential of each product or service.</p>
    <p>For example, take a look at your company’s current market share for each product. It might be:</p>
    <p>Revenue (Current Market Share) = $100 million</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>5. Identify The Distribution Channel That Will Provide The Potential Customers For Your Business In 2022</h2>
    <p>Depending on the characteristics of your target demographic, identify the distribution channel that would cater to
      their needs by providing them with a variety of products and services.</p>
    <p>You have to decide whether you want to sell your products and services directly or whether you want to sell through
      distributors and retailers.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>6. Identify The Consumer Buying Behavior For Each Product or Service</h2>
    <p>Once you identify who your target demographic is, look at the consumer buying behavior of your target audience in
      order to understand their needs and common purchasing factors.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>7. Analyze Competitors in Your Market Research</h2>
    <p>In order to look at all opportunities for improvement, it’s important for you to take a close look at the
      competitors in your market research so that you are able to identify what strategies have worked for them and what
      strategies could possibly work for your business as well.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>8. Develop a Marketing Plan That Is Unique To You</h2>
    <p>Every company or entrepreneur is unique in some way. So, it’s important for you to develop a marketing plan that is
      unique to you and your business so that you are able to showcase your strengths, build on your weaknesses, and
      create opportunities.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Final words</h2>
    <p>Planning your marketing strategy in 2022 is just the starting point. You have to <b>implement the food and beverage
        marketing plan</b> that you came up with during this planning process by 2022.</p>
    <p>It’s important for you to remember that there is a lot more that goes into creating a successful marketing plan for
      your business than just developing a marketing strategy in 2022. Planning your marketing strategy in 2022 means that
      you have identified what <b>beverage marketing strategy</b> would work best for your business and how the
      opportunity can be improved if necessary.</p>

    description:

  <p>Businesses are always on the lookout for new strategies they can use to get ahead of the competition. Search engine
    optimization, commonly abbreviated as SEO, is one of those strategies that can be used by small businesses to create a
    name for themselves online. If you’re not sure how SEO for local restaurants could be helpful, here are just a few of
    the ways that SEO for restaurants could help build your brand.</p>
  <h2>1. SEO Helps Boost Profits</h2>
  <p>Small business owners tend to only pay attention to their bottom line, so when you see them attribute Google search
    engine results to an increase in sales, you can be sure that this is because of SEO. However, SEO doesn’t just help
    your bottom line — it’s also a great way to build the reputation of your small business online.</p>
  
  <p>Other Local Businesses: Whether or not your local restaurant is a startup or well-established, chances are that they
    could benefit greatly from using Google and other search engines too (and you should consider building up their
    profile on GMB as well).</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>2. SEO helps boost traffic to your restaurant</h2>
  <p>Search engine optimization can also help drive traffic to your restaurant’s website and encourage consumers to visit
    frequently. When potential customers start searching for your business using phrases such as “Best restaurants near
    me” or “best local restaurants” — they’ll most likely see what they’re looking for on Google locator’s search results
    pages, with a map of the area and ratings and reviews of nearby restaurants.</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>3. SEO helps generate more leads</h2>
  <p>When people type keywords into a search engine related to your business, you have the chance to capture their
    information. In addition, simply being visible in the Google results will increase your chances of collecting more
    leads.</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>4. SEO helps provide your restaurant with more exposure to social media</h2>
  <p>One of the ways that you can use SEO to boost your online presence is by making sure that you have a presence on as
    many social media platforms as possible. This will help you ensure that any Google searches related to your business,
    either by name or other relevant keywords, will turn up results that include your social media and website listings.
  </p>
  
  <p>The extra exposure can generate leads and interest in your restaurant and its menu which can also lead to more
    frequent visits from customers (and potentially new customers). If they like what they see online, they’ll check out
    the reviews and get more information about the businesses through Google and other search engines.</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>5. SEO helps lay the groundwork for long-term success</h2>
  <p>The only way SEO can generate traffic to your restaurant is if your website has a high ranking in the search engines.
    This means, that even if you can’t see results right away, you have to be careful about keyword density, content, and
    other factors that help boost your ranking so that you get more traffic over the long term. That’s why it’s best to
    hire a professional who can provide your local business with everything they need to build their online presence.</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>6. SEO helps build your restaurant’s brand</h2>
  <p>Ultimately, SEO is all about creating an online presence for your business. If you want potential customers to know
    more about you and check out your website, you need to pay attention to what keywords you’re using on your website.
    But once you have a presence in the search engines, it’s important to make sure that it’s easy for people to find what
    they’re looking for online.</p>
  
  <p>If most of your content is related to the products and services you provide (and include original photos of using
    those products), that will help people find what they’re looking for more quickly so that they can come in and try out
    your food.</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>SEO can help you build your restaurant to be more successful and grow your business, so don’t hesitate to leave us a
    comment if you have any questions.</p>`,

    <p>Being a restaurant owner is exciting, challenging, and requires lots of work. Can you see yourself, lunch rush
      accompanying you as usual, with all the food orders coming in? Or are you looking to take on the challenge of
      performance marketing? The chances are high that if you have even thought about launching a new concept or selling
      your restaurant’s services to different venues, performance marketing is one of the ways.</p>
    <p>Searching for a performance marketing company?</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Here are 6 steps to do performance marketing for restaurants.</h2>
  </div>
  <br />
  
  <div>
    <h2>1) Learn what works:</h2>
    <p>What do you really need to know when getting started?</p>
  
    <p>What is the right place to start with performance marketing? Perhaps your competitors are already doing it, and
      they have been able to take advantage of the changing times.</p>
  
    <p>If this is the case, you can choose not to bother yourself. However, if you wish to make things work for yourself,
      then it would be great if you know what works for your competition in terms of generating traffic and sales.</p>
  
    <p>You would want to understand the way or the ways that make their model successful. You should also learn where they
      are spending most of their resources; things like search engine marketing (SEM), social media, pay-per-click (PPC)
      advertising campaigns, etc.</p>
  </div><br />
  <div>
    <h2>2) Diversify:</h2>
    <p>If you are still considering performance marketing as a new, exciting proposition in the face of what is already
      established and working for your competitors.</p>
  
    <p>But if you have decided to do it anyway, then you should choose a different approach. If your competitors are
      utilizing everything from those mentioned above to their advantage, then there is no point in trying to perform the
      exact same way.</p>
  
    <p>Instead of that, why not take a more holistic approach? Focus on generating traffic and sales from both organic
      search traffic and paid advertising campaigns while taking into account social media. Then when all these are done,
      focus on conversion rate optimization (CRO) and learn how to brand yourself among your target audience.</p>
  </div><br />
  
  
  <div>
    <h2>) Budget:</h2>
    <p>How much can you really afford to do? In most cases, the answer is always: it depends. What is more important is to
      get a realistic figure in mind first. That will help you decide what kind of budget you can actually afford and
      where you should put it.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>4) Identify your target market:</h2>
    <p>This would be an aspect that needs to be carefully done for every performance marketing campaign. Why just leave
      the possibilities to run wild?</p>
  
    <p>It would be great being able to know exactly how many people are likely to come from each area when looking at the
      demographic data of your location. If your target audience is potential customers from surrounding areas and
      regions, then it would be best if you ran advertisements in those areas as well.</p>
  
    <p>If however you just want to focus on the same sets of people that go to your location, then it would be better if
      you consider doing store advertising as well.</p>
  </div><br />
  
  
  <div>
    <h2>5) Define your objectives:</h2>
    <p>Once you have decided how to create and run performance marketing for restaurant campaigns, it’s time to figure out
      what you would want it to achieve.</p>
  
    <p>There are some common objectives for which companies do performance marketing. These may include anything from
      generating sales and traffic, getting leads, managing foot traffic, and closing sales.</p>
  
    <p>Different types of campaigns will be needed for each objective. It is best being able to know exactly what kind of
      campaign would work best for your purpose and initial goals.</p>
  </div><br />
  <div>
    <h2>6) Continuously Creating Content:</h2>
    <p>Nowadays, it has always been advised to create and post fresh and unique content to increase the visibility of
      commercial websites. This method is not only applicable to website owners but can also be used by restaurants for
      promotional purposes.</p>
  
    <p>You should have a constant flow of new content or articles ready to be posted on your social media platforms such
      as Facebook and Twitter. Be sure to always use full image descriptions too while posting. Your customers will
      appreciate the extra information as they read through your posts, some of them may also make bookings or get
      interested in what you have so much available in store.</p>
  </div><br />
  <div>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>If you are still thinking about what to do as your first step in terms of performance marketing for restaurants,
      then this article should answer all your questions. After doing a little bit of research on what has been working
      for others, you will be able to establish how you would want to start, where to put your budget, and when or when
      not to go for each type of campaign.</p>
  
    <p>You might have the right idea but it may take some time and effort before you get the results that match your
      expectations.</p>

    <p>Unless you have been living under a rock, the name MetaVerse might sound a bit familiar to you. Everyone everywhere
      is talking about it. There have been discussions and debates around this topic. But what really is MetaVerse?</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>What is MetaVerse?</h2>
    <p>Well simply put into words, MetaVerse is basically a three-dimensional network of virtual reality worlds that only
      exists within the walls of reality headsets. It’s incredibly futuristic and something you see in science fiction
      novels and movies. But now as the human species is rapidly evolving and advancing its technology at a much faster
      rate, a “virtual life” is very much becoming the new hot topic considering how possible all of it looks now. Meta,
      formerly known as Facebook, has recently launched its Oculus VR Series which is one of the most advanced virtual
      reality headsets ever created.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>What can You do in MetaVerse?</h2>
    <p>You can do anything that doesn’t necessarily require your physical presence. You can play games with friends and
      hang out in a comedy club afterward in the form of avatars. You can go to places that exist in a particular
      augmented reality (AR) which is just a computerized representation of the real world and just roam around and enjoy
      passing your time. You can also go to know places that do not exist and have a good time like in the case of several
      Virtual Reality where you can grab the rest of your gear and smash fruits with your virtual sword.</p>
  
    <p>But the real reason why we are here right now is to discuss the effect the MetaVerse will have on the food and
      beverage industry. How will restaurants and cafés work in such an environment? Well, we are here to help you break
      it down and make you understand the A to Z on this concern.</p>
  
    <p>But before that, we would like to talk about NFTs which is another one of the trending topics right now. To briefly
      understand non-fungible tokens, you will need to understand a form of currency exchange that is not really equal in
      value. 15 coins can be traded for 15 coins because they possess the same value. However, every NFT is unique and
      can’t be equaled by a value.</p>
  
    <p>Now, moving on to ……</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>The Effect of MetaVerse on the Food and Beverage Industry</h2>
    <p>People are investing millions of dollars into the metaverse to acquire digital property. A lot of digital real
      estate is for sale now in the metaverse and investors are constantly trying to clasp the best deals. In the same
      way, the big names in the food and beverage industry are trying to come up with creative ways to invest in the food
      market of the metaverse. There have been talks of even exchanging real food for NFTs.</p>
  
    <p>Imagine you are in the metaverse, and you acquire the NFTs to an XYZ restaurant through a game or by any other
      means, you could even end up exchanging that token for a real meal from the XYZ restaurant in the real world. All of
      this sounds exciting and confusing at the same time, doesn’t it?</p>
  
    <p>We completely understand! MetaVerse is still in this very fetal stage and it will take a while before we start
      going into virtual restaurants with our friends and families as Avatars but a business needs to be prepared for the
      opportunity when it drops by.</p>
  
    <p>But you shouldn’t be waiting for the expansion of MetaVerse in order to market your food and beverage business and
      should start now. If the marketing side of the business has a habit of overwhelming you, don’t worry about it, and
      go to <a href='/'>www.fielmente.com</a> to book your free hospitality marketing consulting now!</p>

    <p>Marketing in the restaurant industry is challenging. There are so many different jobs to do, so many aspects of
      customer service, and so many ways to do things wrong.</p>
    <p>But when done the right way, marketing in restaurants can result in much happier customers and much higher profits
      for everyone involved! This is why we’ve created this handy list of 7 <b>restaurant marketing strategies in
        India</b> that will help you keep your customers happy while you grow your business.</p>

  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Best 7 Restaurant Marketing Strategies in India</h2>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>1) Listen To Your Customers: </h2>
    <p>The only way to know what works best for your restaurant is to listen to your customers. Your menu, the way you
      serve dishes, and even the design of your restaurant can all be improved by listening.</p>
    <p>Consider how many restaurants have outside seating during the summer. Not too many. But they do have a great deal
      of business in that section of their restaurant! Now consider how many restaurants have inside seating on a hot
      summer day and barely any business. Not too many. That is the power of hearing what customers want. Don’t try to be
      everything for everyone.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>2) Provide Something Different:</h2>
    <p>Regardless of what you eat, people need something to make them stop and do something different. Sometimes people
      just like to sit around and talk, and if you have seating for that, people will be much more likely to stop in for a
      bite to eat.</p>
    <p>This applies elsewhere in the restaurant as well. If you have an area where people can get outside and play games,
      or just sit and relax, then even more people will be inclined to come in for a bite to eat.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>3) Offer Complimentary Items:</h2>
    <p>The best way to make a customer happy is to give them something for free in appreciation for their business. There
      is nothing wrong with surprising your customers with a complimentary appetizer, dessert, or even drink.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>4) Have A Unique Menu:</h2>
    <p>Your menu should be different and unique. If you are not offering something that people cannot get anywhere else,
      then you may as well not have much of a restaurant at all.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>5) Send Out Loyalty Cards or Discounts: </h2>
    <p>Loyalty programs are incredibly common, which is why they work so well. But the best loyalty program you can have
      is one where you send out cards or discounts to your customers that let them know how much you appreciate their
      business.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>6) Maintain Quality Systems (i.e. HACCP): </h2>
    <p>Having a clean restaurant is important, but having a clean restaurant that is free of contaminants is even more
      important. Food safety is one of the most vital parts of doing business in the hospitality industry and it has been
      proven time and time again that it can be an incredibly successful strategy for restaurants.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>7) Check-In on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter:</h2>
    <p>One of the most effective ways that businesses can stay up to date is by being on social media. Not only will you
      be able to know what is going on with your customers, but you could also build a loyal following in the process.</p>
    <p>Make sure that your brand is represented correctly and in an appealing way, and set a good example for your
      customers. This can create a strong bond between your restaurant and its customers, which will result in better
      business down the road.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>Final words</h2>
    <p>This is not an exhaustive list of marketing strategies. This list was created to be complementary to the knowledge
      you already have and are familiar with. If you have a different marketing strategy that has helped you, or know that
      other strategies work, please feel free to share them in the comments below!</p>

  <p>We personally believe that the first step towards success lies in building a strong brand. The journey may be a bit
    tiresome and time-consuming but do not lose hope – we’re here with you to guide you till the end.</p>
  <p>We have been there when it was very tough to stand out against our competitors and slowly, with years of effort and
    hard work, we have made our mark in the market as one of the most admired names out there! ????</p>
  <p>We assisted The Asian Wok to set up its cloud kitchen in Kolkata, did their social media, provided them with
    consultation, helped them with menu and signage designing, and viola – they’re doing amazing today! Check out the pdf
    below and let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!</p>
  <p>Get in touch with us today for a free consultation and let’s create some magic together! When we first started with
    Fielmente, people often told us, “What’s so special about it? There are already loads of agencies doing exactly the
    same!”</p>
  <p>And we cannot find a better day than today to reply to that!</p>
  <p>One of the most valuable clients of Fielmente, ‘The Asian Wok” has spread its wings with loads of new customers and
    orders incoming every day!</p>
  <p>What did Fielmente do?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>We helped them start from scratch and helped them create an effective roadmap.</li>
    <li>We did their branding – designed their logo, made a color pallet, and designed intriguing menu options for them.
    </li>
    <li>Then we hopped on social media – we helped them to build a strong online presence through organic postings and ads
      and created various offers and deals to attract more and more orders.</li>
    <li>Later on, we also designed their signage boards for a bit of offline marketing and it started to work like a
      wonder!</li>
    <li>Our team provided them with 24/7 consultation to assist them whenever they got stuck at any place, at any time.
    </li>
    <li>We helped them set up the whole Cloud Kitchen restaurant in Kolkata and guided them to deliver proper orders with
      proper packaging on time.</li>
  
  </ol>
  <p>And there it is – they’re doing more than great today! Fielmente doesn’t just take up orders and complete them – we
    stand by our clients from start to end until they become highly profitable and well-branded!</p>
  <p>We want to thank our clients for giving us this opportunity to prove our potential to them and a big kudos to team
    Fielmente for excellent coordination and all the hard work!</p>

    <p>Through exclusive groups and broadcast listing, small enterprises sell their offerings to their specific clients to
      create strong interactions with them. On the other hand, medium-sized and big businesses utilize the new premium
      WhatsApp Business API to enjoy their consumers by providing them with information about their purchases, receiving
      customer feedback, and even frequent updates.<br /> WhatsApp can be a really good way to directly connect with your
      consumers. There is nothing special you can do in this, it is just that you will be reaching each one of consumers,
      directly to them, unlike social media platforms.</p>
    <p>WhatsApp enables brands to establish a business page on the app, which is similar to Facebook. Your profile will
      provide customers with crucial information like location, description, website, and contact information. A catalog
      may
      also be added.<br />
      You may contact consumers directly if you utilize WhatsApp Business. You may also automate messages with a chatbot
      so
      that your viewers can respond fast to their inquiries.</p>

    <h2>Tips on how to increase engagement</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tweets with photographs enhance retweets by an average of 35 percent. Please remember to keep the messages under
        the limit for retweets and comments at least 20 characters.</li>
      <li>Facebook’s algorithm favors short text postings, which implies that they appear more frequently. However, the
        algorithm can change and you will have the ability to influence your audience’s interaction with Facebook posts
        with less language.</li>
      <li>Remember: You publish your brand, so publish true “insider” pictures at greater engagement rates.</li>
    </ul>

      of Management the effect on Indian Hotel Business by Dr Jasveen Kaur and Jobanjeet Kaur – Assessing the Impact of
      Corona Virus (COVID-19) on Tourism and Hospitality Industry in India- a Perspective Study stated that the occupancy

      tourism industry leading to uncertainty and fear among all stakeholders. </p>

    <h2>Drop in the hotel occupancy rates</h2>
    <p>Hotel occupancy rates fell 20-40% while revenue per room for four-star hotels went down 65-70 %. The revenue for
      two-star hotels was also down by 50-60%. This negative impact on the hotel industry made us all think!</p>
  
    <p>According to <b>Smith Travel Research (STR) and Oxford Economics,</b> hotel revenue around the world dropped to
      half of what
      it was. The operating profit per available room dropped for the United States (down 122.8%), Asia-Pacific (down
      124.1%), Europe (down 131.9%), and the Middle East (down 124.1%).</p>
  
    <p>But the situation has changed for the better in 2023. Revenues are rising as people are traveling again. Though the
      danger of a lockdown has not completely faded these three years have given us a lot to learn.</p>
  
    <p>The pandemic sure taught us how to survive and how to build from zero which no college or classroom taught us.

    <h2>Strategies for Hotel Business to Overcome Emergencies and Achieve Success in New Normal</h2>
    <img src="/images/blog/last-2nd-bg.png" alt="hero" />
    <br />
    <h2>Management- Improve your hotel business in the new normal</h2>
    <p>The hotel business has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, but there are things that <b>hotel managers can</b>
      do to
      adapt to the new normal and <b>achieve success.</b></p>
  
    <p>First and foremost <b>devise an emergency management plan.</b> This plan should cover all scenarios related to
      emergencies
      including natural disasters, pandemics, and security threats.</p>
  
    <p><b>Create a safe and healthy environment for your guests and staff.</b> The cleaning and sanitizing procedures must
      be
      followed strictly. Also, maintain a healthy supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff.</p>
  
    <p>Establish a <b>connection with travel agents as they are a valuable source of bookings</b> for hotels. Even during
      the
      off-season travel agents can increase your visibility to potential guests and generate more reservations.</p>
  
    <p><b>Monitor your guest’s travel history to ensure their safety.</b> It will help you to properly sanitize the rooms
      and take
      preventive measures if needed.</p>
  
    <p><b>Implement low-season strategies.</b> It is often very difficult to maintain a steady occupancy rate during low
      season, so
      come up with strategies for the same. Even during the off-season, there are things you can do to increase hotel
      occupancy and generate revenue. Like,</p>
  
    <p>– <b>Offer competitive rates and discounts</b> to attract budget-minded travelers.
  
    <p>– <b>Offer package deals</b> that include accommodation, meals, activities, or other amenities that your hotel can
      provide.
  
    <p>– <b>Run promotions for large groups</b> of families or business travelers.
  
    <p>– <b>Host events</b> such as conferences, expos, weddings, holiday parties, flea markets or music festivals.
  
    <p>– You can also <b>target specific markets</b> such as business travelers, families or couples.
      <img src="/images/blog/last-2nd-bg2.png" alt="hero">
  
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Staff Training for Improved Hotel Business</h2>
    <p>As any hotel owner would agree, our <b>staff is the face of the hotel.</b> Their interactions with a guest can make
      or
      break experiences. That is why training the staff is crucial.</p>
    <br />
    <p><b>– Provide ample training</b> to the staff in safety and security procedures.</p>
  
    <p>– Teach the staff to interact and inform them <b>how to handle guests in case of threats.</b></p>
  
    <p>– Train the staff <b>how to use new technology</b> like a mobile app or check-in systems.</p>
  
    <p><b>– Empower staff</b> to make decisions and actions. This will build the trust and faith of customers in your
      service.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Technology for improved hotel business</h2>
    <p>Post-pandemic era is all about good technology. Being in the industry we are seeing a steady rise in new
      technological implementations.</p>
    <p>A few of them are:</p>
    <p>– Mobile App for Booking and Tracking</p>
  
    <p>– Mobile App for Food Delivery</p>
  
    <p>– Software for training and work-from-home</p>
  
    <p>– Robots for Cleaning and Guest’s Services</p>
  
    <p>– Sensors for contactless services</p>
  
    <p>– Resource Management apps</p>
    <p>Apart from these, a few more technological changes are required:</p>
    <p><b>– Using emails for email marketing</b></p>
    <p>Email marketing is one of the best ways to market. You have to prepare an email list of your past guests and
      potential guests. Send them emails about your offers, coupons and other important dates.</p>
    <p><b>– Build an online reputation</b></p>
    <p>Focus on your reviews and ratings. Make sure the brand identity is maintained. It builds trust and reputation. This
      has long-term benefits as well. Reviews and ratings help bring new guests. So answer any questions or respond to
      queries online.</p>
    <p>– Get registered on meta-search engines like Trivago and TripAdvisor. This will boost your visibility and
      reputation. This will also increase your reach to potential guests.</p>
    <p><b>– Start a social media page</b></p>
    <p>The pandemic has drastically increased social media users. So, make use of it. Social media posts by guests will
      also <b>increase your brand’s exposure.</b> Facebook and Instagram are good operations. You can also try Pinterest.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>– SEO Optimize your hotel’s website </p>
    <p>It will help to <b>gain visibility on search engines</b> like Google and Yahoo. The results are long-term and if
      executed
      properly will skyrocket your revenue in a few months.</p>
    <p>After reading the technological strategies you might ask,</p>

  <p>The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) issued an order on 13 March 2026 temporarily relaxing the approved fuel norms for industries, hotels, restaurants, and other establishments operating in the National Capital Region (NCR). This decision comes in response to disruptions in global energy supply and the regulated distribution of natural gas in India.</p>
  <img src="/images/blog/caqm-relaxes.jpeg" alt="caqm-relaxes" />
  
    <h2>Why This Order Was Issued</h2>

    <p>The Government of India introduced the Natural Gas (Supply Regulation) Order, 2026, which prioritizes the supply of natural gas to essential sectors. Due to these regulations and supply disruptions, many commercial establishments reported operational challenges caused by limited PNG availability. Following consultations with the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, City Gas Distribution Companies, and Pollution Control Boards, CAQM reviewed the situation and provided temporary flexibility in fuel usage for NCR businesses.</p>

    <h2>Temporary Alternative Fuels Allowed</h2>

    <p>Hotels and restaurants are now permitted to temporarily use alternative fuels instead of natural gas. The allowed fuels include High-Speed Diesel (HSD), Biomass, and RDF Pellets (Refuse-Derived Fuel). If these fuels are unavailable, establishments may also temporarily use coal or kerosene. This relaxation applies to industries, hotels, restaurants, and other enterprises operating across the NCR region, including Delhi.</p>

    <h2>Duration of the Relaxation</h2>

    <p>The permission to use alternative fuels is temporary and valid for one month from the date of the order (13 March 2026), or until further instructions are issued. All other provisions of CAQM Direction No. 65 dated 23 June 2022 will remain unchanged.</p>

    <h2>What This Means for Hotels and Restaurants</h2>

    <p>For hospitality operators in NCR, this decision provides practical operational relief. Hotels and restaurants that rely heavily on PNG for kitchens, boilers, and heating systems can continue operations without interruption by switching to permitted alternative fuels when necessary.</p>

    <h2>Strategic Considerations for Hospitality Businesses</h2>

    <p>The current situation highlights the importance of operational resilience and energy diversification. Hotels and restaurants should evaluate hybrid fuel systems, energy-efficient equipment, and contingency planning to reduce dependence on a single energy source.</p>

      Everybody talks about Social Media management and creating an appealing website when it comes to marketing. But Fielmente has come up with more. Break the barriers of traditional marketing that everyone follows, and learn some new customer retention ways!
    </p>

    <p>
      Ghost Kitchen is a new term that many haven’t heard of. Ghost kitchens are also termed cloud kitchens or shadow kitchens. They are actual restaurants with a place set up for cooking with the best chefs but do not offer dine-in services. They only provide deliver-only meals.
    </p>

    <h2>Create your Loyalty Program</h2>

    <p>
      To attract new customers to your ghost kitchen, a loyalty program shall be on your bucket list to engage with new clients. This is essential because faithful customers expend more and act as ideal brand preachers. To retain new customers, incentivize them via Loyalty Programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Loyalty Program offers customers monetary benefits or other rewards in terms of -
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Coupons,</li>
      <li>order-based points,</li>
      <li>home delivery,</li>
      <li>points to customers for giving positive reviews on websites,</li>
      <li>points for posting review content on their social media profiles,</li>
      <li>Referral codes</li>
      <li>deal of the day, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Establish your brand voice with packaging</h2>

    <p>
      Food Packaging creates a crucial role in establishing your brand voice among customers. To be an ultimate ghost kitchen brand, your packaging must stand out from the crowd. If the packaging is eye-catching, it will boost your online ordering revenue from customers and clients.
    </p>

    <p>Food packaging must reflect the theme of your ghost kitchen business.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Incorporate your restaurant’s symbol on the packets</li>
      <li>Use the best-in-market food packaging material that delivers an outstanding customer experience.</li>
      <li>Consider using sustainable or recyclable containers that are durable so that the customers can use them several times for various purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Create a brand recall on reviewing sites</h2>

    <p>
      Online consumer reviews and feedbacks are critical for any ghost kitchen business, just like a brick-and-mortar restaurant. As customers cannot physically visit and participate in dining, they depend heavily on the reviews put on food delivery apps or restaurant review sites. Ghost kitchen brands that have high positive ratings have the chance of receiving more orders online.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>You can send an automated SMS or Email to your buyers as soon as their food is delivered, pitching them to review your ghost kitchen.</li>
      <li>You can consider providing customers with a digital feedback form with a link.</li>
      <li>Partner with food delivery apps. Consumers can rate your food there too.</li>
      <li>Partner review sites so that buyers can rate your kitchen on websites. This increases the chance of Local SEO.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Master the Art of Online Menu Management‍</h2>

    <p>
      The menu is something very important for a ghost kitchen because there is no physical establishment for dine-in. Customers have to choose based on names and photographs. So -
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Set proper names for every dish and combo. Make it eye-catching yet understandable.</li>
      <li>Include pictures for every dish.</li>
      <li>Add accurate food descriptions for every dish and drink.</li>
      <li>Consider adding cost-effective dishes for everyone in the market.</li>
      <li>You must put your menus on your website and other food delivery platforms.</li>
      <li>Make sure your ghost kitchen logo and design are identical across all media and menus.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Influencer Marketing</h2>

    <p>
      People are enthusiastic to know about recipes, food, and the nutritional value of the dishes. Thousands of food bloggers are active on the internet, especially on Instagram, sharing about food, the place of food, and much more related. Influencer marketing can be the key to your success for food startups like ghost or cloud kitchen. Influencers can share your food, rate it, make video content, and more.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Make a list of famous food bloggers with potential followers who are available for new projects.</li>
      <li>Approach them to promote your brand.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The next step is ....... Haha! Let Fielmente handle it for you to get the best ROI
    </p>

    <h2>Let Fielmente do it for you</h2>

    <p>
      A good cafe marketing strategy is a series of methods to showcase and promote your company to customers. But there is some reality that cafe owners must face. Let us talk about them and their solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge: Fewer Visitors</h2>
    <h2>Solution: Create Fancy Coffee Cups</h2>

    <p>
      You can create fabric coffee cups with cool or aesthetic designs, and your customers will adore them. Especially school kids and college students will start visiting your cafe daily just to drink coffee in cute cups! You can even create multiple designs with a slight difference in price and let customers choose from — people love being given the opportunity to choose. This is one of the simplest and cost-effective ways of traditional advertisement
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge: No Customer Retention</h2>
    <h2>Solution: Offer Bottomless Mug Policy</h2>

    <p>
      Coffee lovers usually drink twice or even more. So you can retain your potential customers by offering them a bottomless mug. Not just coffee lovers, most customers will stay for longer with this method.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wait, what is a bottomless mug? Mug with no bottom? Haha.. NO! It is a method of offering free refills till they leave the cafe. You can obviously charge a higher one-time payment for this service. This method makes buyers feel they’re obtaining an excellent deal and welcome many nighters.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge: Less Visitors during a certain time of the year</h2>
    <h2>Solution: Create Seasonal Drinks</h2>

    <p>
      Many cafes in the market serve the same stuff - coffee every day, the whole year — boring. Like in India, people do not prefer coffee during summer; hence no visitors. You can create a refreshing smoothie to attract customers. You need revenue, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Seasonal drinks break the monotony of your morning coffee. So, many people will prefer to try new drinks and tastes. With this marketing concept, your cafe can be the spotlight among customers seeking a change and distinguishes you from your competitor.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge: Local visitors prefer other cafes</h2>

    <h2>Solution: Create Directional Signage</h2>

    <p>
      I am talking about traditional old-school signage, like billboards and bus shelters.
    </p>

    <p>
      It may not be an effective medium to attract customers from far away places. Still, outdoor can be an effective and functional way to get your brand in front of large, 100% local customers. Even digital marketing cannot do it that effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s a scheme that fast-food chains have been practicing for decades:
    </p>

    <p>

      How would you like to be ignored? not good right? Similarly, when people visit your website or digital marketplace they are filled with queries and expect someone to solve them, but again on your end you are also not available all the time, and you can’t put every bit of information online, that’s where automation of your hotel’s Google my business messages is important. It is very critical in the hospitality sector. Just imagine you are anyone interested in staying in your hotel is mandatory to have multiple doubts and queries, like the exact address, additional services, discounts, location, distance and whatnot, and therefore it becomes inevitable for you to automate your google my business messages for your hotel, having said that, here is a quick guide how to setup adopt automation for your hotel
    </p>

    <h2>Prepare a response team</h2>

    <p>
      Set a live agent, and do remember that visitors often like prompt replies and so also set up a messaging availability for it, this explains to the visitor that humans are not available.
    </p>

    <p>
      As much as people like to avoid human interaction they often like someone to have a direct conversation with them and solve their queries, It is good to have automated messages set, but its also good to redirect visitors to a support number they can call or to a website with simple FAQs to help them resolve their queries
    </p>

    <h2>Be ready with follow-up responses</h2>

    <p>
      It often happens that many live agents repeat their answers to the visitors, and it is just frustrating for the visitors to keep up the conversation because they know that live agents or automation are offering predetermined replies
    </p>

    <p>
      Don’t do that, on the contrary, always have good follow responses ready so that the visitors can feel good about your message automation.
    </p>

    <h2>Don’t react, respond</h2>

    <p>
      Suppose a visitor has a query that does not fit in the usual responses immediately send them the support number, this way you are ensuring a healthy response which is also called a proactive fallback. If the live agent or automated message doesn’t answer in the right path, it will immediately ruin the visitor’s interest.
    </p>

    <h2>Offer prompt transition</h2>

    <p>
      Never hold a visitor for extra questions from the automated response end, if it is clear what the visitor is asking immediately perform the handoffs. If they want to have human interaction, send the support number asap, this way you are building swift, active and agile conversation. Never set a complex question for the visitor, they are more interested in asking rather than replying.
    </p>

    <h2>Set customized messages</h2>

    <p>
      There are options for customizing messaging automation, the more personal or brand-oriented message it is, the more there are chances for a visitor to remember it.
    </p>

    <p>
      At last, people always remember the good services offered, if you are a hotel owner with a website, automated messages and live agents can be your first impression and conversation starters with your potential customers.
    </p>

    <h2>A few quick tips would be -</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Have a response time</li>
      <li>Don’t let visitors ask the question twice, they don’t like it</li>
      <li>Keep the messaging crisp and on point, informative.</li>
      <li>Share quality information</li>
      <li>Always be responsive</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      “Good messages create great impressions”
    </p>

    <p>
      We guess that if you are already going through this blog means you are interested in setting up automation for your hotel business having said that, Fielmente is here you to help you elevate your Google my business strategies along with multiple marketing services as per your choice.

    <h1>Why Contenting Marketing Is Crucial For Hotels And Restaurants</h1>

    <p>
      We'll just assume that if you stumbled on this blog, you want to learn more about content marketing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Is it just a fancy word for you in the world of social media and digital marketing?

      If you are reading this blog, we guess you are interested in using content marketing as your strength. As a popular <strong>restaurant marketing agency</strong>, we are here to give you all the insights you need on content marketing.

    <p>
      Now in simple terms, content marketing is nothing but the creation and distribution of content to elevate your business’s growth, reach, reputation, and brand image. You might think, why create so much content? What is its ultimate goal?
    </p>

    <p>
      So, let’s go through a step-by-step understanding of how and why content marketing is important for your hotel and restaurant businesses and clear all looming doubts.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating Audience Attraction</h2>

    <p>
      There are some industries in which content marketing plays a vital role compared to others. The hospitality sector is one such industry because it is all about influencing the mindset of clients, attracting them, and making them avail the services as much as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The better your content marketing skills get, you will attract clients organically. If you need expert insights, you can connect with a <strong>hotel digital marketing agency</strong> to explore more avenues.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating a Competitive Advantage</h2>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      Just like this, with all the content you create or already have that can be optimized, what are you doing with it? And most importantly; what is it that you are doing that your competitors are not? The answer is the same; content marketing offers a competitive advantage and edge to your hotels and restaurants because you are going the extra mile.
    </p>

    <h2>Affordable Marketing</h2>

    <p>
      If you are a hotelier, you know how expensive and explicit the marketing budgets are. In such a scenario, content marketing is convenient, cheap, creative, centralized, and most importantly the core of digital marketing strategies. A content marketing strategy is a multi-layered approach to content creation and distribution through various channels with specific goals and time-bound expectations.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Content= Your Reputation</h2>

    <p>
      Suppose, you promote your services through newsletters or a digital magazine that is solely focused on the hospitality industry. From the perspective of a <strong>hotel digital marketing agency</strong>, this is a great move!
    </p>

    <p>
      The use case can be explained very easily.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A client planning for a trip abruptly checks his email at night.</li>
      <li>He finds your newsletter in his inbox, reads it, and likes your content.</li>
      <li>He is intrigued to know more about your services & therefore, searches your hotel on Google.</li>
      <li>When he comes across your digital magazine, he is delighted and visits your official hotel website.</li>
      <li>He is so amazed by your videos, blogs, and content displayed in general that he ends up booking a stay in your hotel.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Now you may think that this is just a far-fetched scenario and nothing like this ever happens. But in reality, this is exactly how targeted searches meet good content and end up earning your hotel good business.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s why we say your content is your reputation and revenue!
    </p>

    <h2>How Can You Create Your Content Marketing Strategy?</h2>

    <p>
      If you have reached this section of the blog, we know you are convinced that you need content marketing for your hotel. So let us help you with some simple actionable steps -
    </p>

    <h2>Hire a Hotel Digital Marketing Agency</h2>

More importantly, your business needs experts who can create quality content and guide you through the labyrinth of digital marketing approaches and strategies.
    </p>

    <h2>Set Your Goals</h2>

    <p>
      Always have clear goals for your business. In the hospitality industry, you need to have measured and decisive goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are confused about what you want to achieve with content marketing, its benefits might never bear fruit.
    </p>

    <h2>Choose Your Channels</h2>

    <p>
      You can’t market content that's made for Facebook via email. It is quintessential to know your channels, and what content works best with it. Most people make this common mistake. It is better to take the time & understand the channel, its relevance to your business, and most importantly, the content best suited for it.
    </p>

    <h2>Pick The Relevant Topics</h2>

    <p>
      Meaningful content on channels and profiles= Booming business.

    <p>
      If you are a hotel, restaurant, or cafe, finding topics that are industry-centered can be a task. Simply consulting with experts can make your doubts go away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Simply being a hotelier does not guarantee that you will be able to gauge what your audience needs. With expert help, your concerns about content marketing can be at ease.

      Maintaining a positive internet reputation for hotels is essential given the country's and the world's growing digital populations. Due to this, ideas and techniques like online reputation management have emerged (ORM). Since more people rely on internet reviews and social media to make booking decisions, it is not surprising that hotel reputation management has become more and more popular.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Hotel Reputation Management Is Important?</h2>

    <p>
      For all hotels, reputation management is crucial, particularly for managing your internet reputation
    </p>

    <p>
      How guests see, evaluate, share, and search for information about your hotel directly impacts its business. Travelers are starting to rely more on online reviews from different travel websites. However, most hotels cannot make the best use of this specific component of the current travel market. Therefore, hoteliers must utilize these technologies to build a positive online reputation while interacting with potential customers in the virtual world and comprehending the significance of the enormous possibility behind ORM.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits Of Upholding A Positive Online Reputation</h2>

    <p>
      The following section lists some of the factors that make keeping a positive hotel reputation online essential for success:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>It Boosts Sales</strong><br/>
        Before making a decision, consumers study brands, services, and products online. People often read online evaluations left by those who have already visited a place before going there. Businesses with positive internet reviews typically draw more customers. Large sales are lost by companies with a poor reputation and those with the most negative evaluations. Because of this, your brand needs to have great online reviews.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>It Enhances Credibility</strong><br/>
        Social media platforms have allowed us to express our opinions on anything. Utilizing trusted brands is preferred by consumers. A bad rumor about your company will get around more quickly than a good one. Again, having no opinion about your company is a symptom of your unreliability and lack of trust. But tackling that will be easier with an efficient ORM strategy and prompt resolution.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>It Contributes To Increased Visibility</strong><br/>
        Positive online evaluations can provide businesses with several chances to improve awareness and influence among potential customers. Online reviews are crucial for managing your hotel's reputation and expanding clientele. Positive evaluations also contribute to the brand's increased visibility, which helps it draw in more customers. Although additional traffic does not always result in more reservations for hotel rooms, it does enhance the likelihood of doing so.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>It Aids In Optimizing Your Revenue</strong><br/>
        In the present, fiercely competitive market and business environment, how consumers perceive your brand directly affects your company's sales and revenue. As a result, it assists in increasing revenue while fostering a positive reputation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Down The Line - What Fielmente can do for you !</h2>

    <p>
      A lot of time and work is required to start and expand a firm. Your existing consumers may be happy with your fantastic services. Still, there is one important issue you must attend to if you want to safeguard and support the expansion of your company. Maintaining your company's online reputation is essential in today's digital age. Because there are so many alternatives available, ORM has become crucial for businesses to monitor, ascertain, and change the digital reputation of brands. A quick online search can frequently provide all the information you need to learn about a company's reputation, which is an important consideration for tourists when choosing where to stay.

    <p>
      If you have come to this blog searching about Alt texts, you might be on your way to upgrading your Instagram algorithm!
    </p>

    <p>
      For many people who don't know about alt-text, it simply means naming or describing pictures while uploading them to your online content. It is for Google to read the images and align them with the SEO practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is widely used in websites and blog posting activities with banners & stock images. But what most people do not know is that using alt-text in social media precisely on Instagram can bring them excellent results for gaining publicity in their niche.
    </p>

    <p>
      The description added with alt text reads aloud with a screen reading program. It helps them clearly identify the thing being talked about.
    </p>

    <p>
      So today in this blog we will encounter some of the key reasons why you should use Alt text in Instagram. We will also guide you on how to add these to your content to make it more engaging!
    </p>

    <p>Use case for Alt Text-</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It helps Instagram sort your image in content and aids in describing photos to blind or impaired users.</li>
      <li>Though Instagram uses object recognition technology to describe your posts, Instagram users can manually add alt text to their photos.</li>
      <li>When you don’t add an alt text, Instagram automatically does it for you. But it is up to you who needs to add key aspects to your posts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Do note that you don’t have to delete your post to add an alt-text to it; you can do it even after you have posted it. To do so-
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Go to the 'edit post' option</li>
      <li>Choose the picture (it will automatically guide you to the standard text)</li>
      <li>You shall find the edit alt text button</li>
      <li>Describe your post in the best way possible.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <strong>An important tip - Try to limit your description to under 100 characters including spaces. Try not to use phrases like - “picture of” or “photo of”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, an important question asked by many is- "Instagram already has object recognition technology, and does the alt text for us? Why do we need to stress about it or do it manually?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The answer is quite simple -  the automated feature of Instagram is highly inaccurate and misinterprets major elements of a photo. Therefore, it is not reliable. When you personally add an alt-text, you bring clarity to reach a wider audience.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Consult a hospitality marketing agency for your concerns</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We hope that we made a point to make you realize how important alt text is in posting on Instagram. To know more critical aspects of digital marketing for your hospitality business, connect with Fielmente today.

    <h1>Why SEO Is Important For Restaurants</h1>

    <p>
      It is not the 90s we are living in, each day technology evolves, and the least smart thing about your smartphone is it being a phone. Rest is what it provides with its browsing, Internet, apps and everything else. More than 80% of all searches start on a smartphone, it is critical to value the top listings and ensure better reach, presence and most importantly a conversion rate. A good <strong>hospitality marketing company</strong> can help you understand all such statistics well but what you as a restaurant owner need to understand first is you are not going to look for a restaurant in a phonebook, today all the reviews, information, likes, dislikes, photos, menu and ratings are available on Google with just a click away. But with this accessibility to customers, it becomes competitive for restaurant businesses to ensure, how do you make sure that your restaurant establishment is gaining the likes, the right traction and visibility on Google.
    </p>

    <p>
      SEO, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      So we all agree that SEO is important for restaurants so now let’s talk about how and how much it is important for restaurants and eateries. SEO farms new customers at a 14.6% rate, which is highly efficient compared to other print advertising and direct mail, that’s the power of SEO.
    </p>

    <h2>Cost-effectiveness</h2>

    <p>
      Today when traditional marketing is failing miserably, and it takes a lot to try marketing channels that may drive attention but are highly expensive, SEO is something cost-effective and offers a focused presence and marketing at the same time. All you need is the right SEO strategy, and all it demands is patience.
    </p>

    <p>
      It doesn’t matter if you are a small restaurant or a big one, SEO can do wonders for you, but it requires patience, with a reasonable budget, a good google my business listing and a location setup, small restaurants can make good visibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Branding</h2>

    <p>
      It is critical and quintessential for small restaurants if you think that all the customers are going to the big-shot restaurant in your area. SEO can help you build your brand with the right tools and strategies, suppose the customers try to find a good restaurant in your area and always see your restaurant’s name on the top, it is most likely that they will visit your restaurant because more visibility means more impact and more impact will lead to a higher conversion rate.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Always have a website ready for your restaurant. It serves as a digital footprint and address for your customers.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Good Traffic leads to great engagement</h2>

    <p>
      Always remember that as a restaurant owner your competitors are already indulging in SEO strategies and, therefore, it becomes a traffic game, for <strong>restaurant advertising</strong> your website, the first search ranking on Google seeks an average click-through rate of 27.5%. No one likes to visit the second page of Google, therefore a good SEO plan ensures higher traffic by letting people click on your restaurant before anyone else. The higher the traffic, the more conversion is possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      As per advanced statistics, it takes up to 5-7 impressions for customers to make a memory of your business. And here we are talking about the restaurant business so your customers need to know you are there. So for your restaurants to gain maximum traffic, traction and ranking, they have to also be on google search results.
    </p>

    <p>
      We hope to have informed you in an exhaustive way how much restaurants need SEO for their business growth

    <h1>10 Amazing Digital Marketing Strategies To Increase Online Bookings</h1>

    <p>
      Today one of the most competitive sectors is the hospitality industry, once the pandemic was offered people started travelling like there was never a pandemic, never existed. It is also important because the hotel industry is directly linked to the tourism industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      People travel, and people stay a lot in hotels and make bookings and plan such trips months before they go or are planning to go. Now, the problem with bookings is that too many options not only raise the competition but also create a lot of clutter and unnecessary ways for people to go search and search and never receive or reach the perfect information and website. Now, in such a scenario, it becomes challenging to come and be at the top, Therefore here we are to discuss 10 amazing digital marketing strategies to help you hike your hotel bookings directly and indirectly -
    </p>

    <h2>The top 10 digital marketing strategies are -</h2>

    <ol>

      <li>
        <strong>Strong presence and internet visibility</strong>
        <p>
          Create a strong presence on the internet, now this may look more easily said than done, but there are multiple ways and operations that you need to perform daily without losing consistency to ensure that your website is receiving traction.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start with the first thing you have to do is to make your website SEO friendly, this is a critical task and may require months of effort to finally get your website ranked or at least get to the first page of search engines. Writing blogs, adding plugins and decorating your website with the right images and videos but at the same time, remember customers have a short span of interest therefore it is important that your hotel website runs effectively during it else the customer will never think twice about leaving your website and never coming back again.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, work on website load speed, optimize it well with the right keywords and take care of both on-page and off-page SEO by creating the right backlinks.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Remarketing</strong>
        <p>
          What better way to market your hotel than to go back and re-engage with customers that have already shown interest in your hotel, they are the best potential customers you have. If you don’t get it, let us explain to you, suppose a customer comes to your website and after a certain amount of time leaves without making a booking, this particular scenario happens a lot because it is the core of human behaviour but then how do you remarket yourself to them?
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer is remarketing will show the same visitor ads of your hotel on different websites they will browse or log in to. The basic concept of this is to keep reminding them of the original interest and trigger them to come back to complete the booking. Moreover, it is not limited to websites but you can retarget them on social media platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interesting fact - statistically, it is proven through remarketing more than 70% of visitors come back to complete their booking.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Increase budget in season months</strong>
        <p>
          We are sorry to break this to you but if you think digital marketing is all about technicality and effort then our answer is no. there are ad campaigns that are executed on different platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Google ads, this way you can promote a particular post for a particular time. But the most important thing to remember is that the marketing budget can vary from time to time. Always target your peak seasons, and know when you can increase your digital marketing budget.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Influencer Marketing</strong>
        <p>
          Now, we know you are a hotel owner and you want that extra marketing done for your hotel by some famous people, obviously not every owner can have a big celebrity endorsing their hotel but that doesn’t mean you lack options. Because today social media platforms and content creation skills have made many creators good and popular internet personalities. You can always connect with them as per their reach and track of social media engagement for example - you can connect with influencers with a reach of 25K, and in the same range let’s say you connect with 4 influencers then you can reach up to one lac potential customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either you pay them in cash or get a barter negotiation for any product. If you are generous enough you can ask them to come and stay in your hotel for a day and night recording everything they do, like, what they eat and visit and posting it on their social media handles to promote your hotel.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>OTA Listing</strong>
        <p>
          If we speak of online travelling agencies, there is a different competition going on between them, some of the famous OTAs in India are GoIbibo, Paytm, Cleartrip, MakeMyTrip and Ixigo, but we talk globally the statistics are promising as well as competitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Approximately 40% of travellers prefer OTAs which means there is 60% of the customer base is yet to be captured, but that 40% is again bifurcated around 30% book through travel agents, and the rest 20% choose other small options available.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shows how much potential customer base is lying unattended which you can capture using good OTA listings.
        </p>

        <strong>Market your location</strong>
        <p>
          In this segment, let’s think about how and why should people be visiting your hotel so often, for it, there has to be a purpose or need for the visitor to come and stay in your hotel, and your hotel alone can’t be the reason for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore comes the element of marketing your location. Initially, it works in tourism aspects where parallel to your hotel you also market your location and play on the factor that your customers are willing or planning to visit your city. You can take advantage of your local popular sites and market them to indirectly market yourself. This is one of the key benefits of hospitality marketing that you can take leverage on other locations to promote your business. Cover festivals, and fairs, gathering and advertising them.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Pamper your loyal customers</strong>
        <p>
          Never forget your loyal customers, they are your biggest assets, and forgetting about them is as common as compromising your taste after building a customer base for your dishes. The more important it is to have new customers it is equally important to make your old customers know how much important they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as far as new customers are concerned, remember your old customers can bring in new customers because there has been no greater publicity ever created than word of mouth and references. From offering free snacks to giving goodbye gifts, people always remember small gestures.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Email marketing</strong>
        <p>
          Let's play out a scenario, you have visitors in your hotel and you collect their data like contact numbers and email addresses this same scenario you can play out on your website as well, by adding a feature of asking browsing visitors to submit their email addresses whenever they come to your website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have the email addresses collected use them as a data source, remember in the age of the internet data is the new oil, start sending blogs to these email addresses or start an update service offering weekly and monthly newsletters to your database customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you do this, you always present in the inbox of your customers and target audience, and it again is a good way of creating a strong presence on the internet. For customers who have visited, this strategy helps in retaining them.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Target the right audience at the right place</strong>
        <p>
          You need to identify places where your target audience resides, it can be an adventure camp or a happening local spot where most people come from outside. Knowing when to find your target audience and reaching out to them is the foremost strategy there is.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we speak of digital marketing strategies, look for online travel communities, or travel clubs and connect with them to partner or invite them for a weekend getaway. Search for travel pages and collaborate with them. Remember anything can be used for marketing, all you need is the right strategy for it.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Keeping one eye on competitors</strong>
        <p>
          Yes, one of the most critical aspects that you timely follow is to ensure that you constantly track the business, operations, offers and activities of your competitors. Self-centred companies tend to fail in the market because eventually, they never thought about what their competitor is doing, and by the time they react, it's already very late.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now here we are not asking you to copy your business rivals but to have in mind the strategies that they are implementing is always a good option.
        </p>

    <h1>How To Market A Hotel Online</h1>

    <p>
      Marketing a hotel is challenging, especially in the modern tourism industry because everyone is trying their best to create an environment of cutthroat competition in the hospitality industry. Gone are the days when traditional marketing techniques used to work in hotels and restaurants. Now, customers want everything at their fingertips.
    </p>

    <p>
      So let’s say you have a hotel business, how are you planning to market it online that too in today’s marketing scenarios? Hoarding and placards won’t work, nor pamphlets nor offline marketing. We are talking about online marketing strategies to promote your hotel. So without wasting any more time let’s check out the main strategies that you need to promote your hotel online -
    </p>

    <h2>Website</h2>

    <p>
      Okay, first things first, you need a website and most importantly you need a hotel website with online booking and reservation options. It is a must, elsewhere else will you promote your business. Understand that websites are your first digital presence, anyone who is searching for your hotel will search for it on Google and without a website, there will be no digital presence or a virtual address to track or send to your customers, therefore a website is a must needed thing for you to have for your hotel.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, you can decorate and attract people to your website using blogs, links, offers, images, graphics, multiple-level options, links, videos and all other forms of content creation that are trending.
    </p>

    <h2>Social Media Presence</h2>

    <p>
      Using and catering to all social media platforms, especially Instagram and Facebook to run ads, good creatives, good hashtags and great creativity are what always pays. Those who do not know about your hotel can reach out to them using social media platforms. You won’t believe but people with product-based businesses have started taking orders on Instagram.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not limited to your marketing only, when people visit new places and hotels they are most likely to click and post pictures on Instagram and tag the place, so when you make a social media presence and let people tag you, you create more organic reach and make people follow you.
    </p>

    <h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>

    <p>
      SEO, is one of the most critical aspects of digital marketing, to know SEO to be updated with it and finally use it for your hotel business are the three most important factors one must practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being updated with Google’s algorithm, optimising every page of the hotel’s website, creating internal external links, using content and tools to create backlinks and using photos, videos, and website credentials to draw more and more people to your business is a tedious task but at the same time, it is worth doing because when done right all these practices pay enormously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not going into detail, but the above three are the critical elements that every hotel business must work on to ensure they are marketing their hotel in the right way. If you have well regulated, monitored and maintained website, you are regularly posting on social media platforms and responsibly working on SEO strategies, you are already head to head with your competitors in terms of marketing, all the other elements like writing blogs, guest posting, email marketing, influencer marketing, google ads, running campaigns quora posting are parts of it.

    <h1>Marketing A Hostel: The Basics</h1>

    <p>
      The history of product marketing spans many centuries, almost as long as there have been goods to sell. But those times when hanging up posters was the thing to do are long gone. We have a wide variety of marketing options at our disposal today. What's best? So many of these are completely free and only call for a little knowledge. Given how quickly the hostel sector is expanding, it is more crucial than ever to use marketing to connect with potential customers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some efficient hostel marketing suggestions that you should not disregard.
    </p>
<ol>

  <li>
    <h2>Maintain Contact With Your Target Market</h2>

    <p>
      One of the foundational pieces of creating your brand is focusing on your target market. Your target demographic will determine your marketing tactics and the channels you should use. Additionally, effectively serving your target customers can help you control a large market segment and establish yourself as an industry leader. You had better start keeping a close eye on them if you do, though.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Trends might support your organic growth by increasing awareness of your chain of hostels.</li>
      <li>Consider memes; utilizing a popular meme format can do wonders for your company and increase brand visibility on appropriate channels.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if your target market is the kind that visits your website or utilizes email, you may adjust your strategy accordingly.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>Referrals & Reviews</h2>

    <p>
      When customers are unsure which brand to choose, reviews can be quite helpful. You may see why by recalling your most recent Amazon purchase, where you read several reviews. Do not be afraid to request reviews from your guests; even better, request them while they stay at your hostel. They're enjoying themselves and will be more likely to give you the positive review you're hoping for because they're having a good time.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Hostels encourage connection and socialization, unlike hotels, which tend to have a sense of isolation.</li>
      <li>Conveying that sense of engagement is critical because doing so will help you build relationships with your audience anywhere you have a presence. However convenient it may sound, avoid using an automated response if possible.</li>
      <li>Personalizing your comments demonstrates your concern and will significantly enhance your audience's perception of you.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>Never Undervalue Your Website</h2>

    <p>
      Do you know how everyone is always stressing how crucial first impressions are? It's accurate and doesn't simply apply to people, though. Even if you contend that people frequently view your Instagram account, remember that everything online ultimately points to your website. Your website needs to target your target demographic and reflect your brand identity effectively.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>Employ SEO</h2>

    <p>
      It's crucial to remember that you must now satisfy your target audience and the search engine algorithms. You can use the power of SEO, many of which may be completed without spending any money. Because of this, it ranks as one of the best marketing counsel for hostels.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use main keywords on your website to start, as they will help you rank better in search engines.</li>
      <li>To determine which terms are more relevant than others, make use of both free and paid web tools like Ubersuggest, Google Adwords, and Google Trends.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>Don't Go Overboard</h2>

    <p>
      We have a dizzying array of marketing techniques, so you must also exercise prudence. This is possibly the most underutilized hostel marketing tip there is. Anyone would not want to be inundated with texts, emails, and forwards everywhere they turn.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Based on the analysis, pick your marketing channels appropriately.</li>
      <li>Although email marketing is effective, that doesn't necessarily indicate that it will be effective for you. Avoid WhatsApp if you won't gain anything from using it as a conduit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ol>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      These practical hostel marketing suggestions are merely the broad strokes of what you ought to be doing. But you need an organized marketing plan to achieve success, which Filemente can provide you. Consistency is essential since doing the right thing will increase your brand awareness and clientele.

    <h1>How Google Map Citation Improves Your Hotel's Online Presence</h1>

    <p>
      If you're not yet familiar with <strong>Google Map citation</strong>, no worries! Simply put, a citation is when you share your business name, address, website, and contact details on other websites. It's a great way to help people find you! These are business listings done by millions of websites that comprise a business listing directory for yours.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, let's start with the basics.
    </p>

    <p>
      You have a business- a restaurant, a cafe, or a hotel per se. What does it mean for you to be listed and viewed on a Google search?
    </p>

    <p>
      When we discuss restaurants, hotels, and eateries, it is not just any business- it is an establishment. As the owner of such an establishment, you would like people to come in as much as possible. You would be elated to know if they enjoyed it, and tell others too. For this to happen different Google and SEO tools like Semrush, Keyword Planner, and Google My Business will help you, and Google Citation is one of the pivotal ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Let's explore how Google citations can enhance your hotel or restaurant's visibility in the digital marketplace.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>SEO Technicalities</h2>

    <p>
      We all want to please Google- and that's a fact! For that, you need to show Google a strong digital presence for your business. It is quite important especially when it comes to cafes, eateries, and restaurants. As your business listings increase, you have a better chance to secure good Google rankings. Being present everywhere with standard, essential details gives your business a very reputed digital structure.
    </p>

    <h2>The Tagging Game</h2>

    <p>
      A good map citation helps a business in multiple ways. We cannot stress it enough! It's critical to make a strong digital presence for your brand. When people visit an impressive place, they like to post stories, click pictures, and most importantly, add its location and tag it. If you are not present on the <strong>Google map citation</strong>, it can significantly impact your business credibility and rankings. Well, that is a big problem! So, to promote organic publicity and attract more visitors, you need an effective map citation on Google.
    </p>

    <h2>For People Who Don't Use Google</h2>

    <p>
      Yes, we know! It's unbelievable. Many people do not use Google as their first option for research. So if a potential customer is trying to search for a good hotel or a restaurant, but searching on a platform other than Google- will you be found? The answer is yes. <strong>Google Map Citation</strong> exists for this very reason. With a clear redirection to your directory listing, it attracts potential clients from anywhere instantly.
    </p>

    <h2>Paid Ads and Subscriptions</h2>

    <p>
      Multiple business listing websites offer premium services and listings for a price. Through this, they keep your business on top of their search results, offer ad banners and many other options for you to promote your business. In India, platforms like Justdial, Indiamart, Sulekha, etc. are great examples. Similarly, some websites allow you to promote your business for free which eventually adds up to your digital business profile and Google citations.
    </p>

    <h2>Business Promotion and Directions</h2>

    <p>
      Suppose a person visited your hotel, liked your service and told all his friends about this amazing stay he had. Now one day, one of his friends decides to visit your hotel based on the good reviews from his friend. But wait- there is no location on the map! Since your hotel never ranked on Google citation, your business lost a potential customer. This is just one example. Things can go wrong in many ways for your future clients.

  <div>

    <h1>How are these restaurants in Canada disrupting the restaurant business through digital marketing</h1>

    <p>
      The restaurant business in Canada has been at an all-time high. The major reason for this is the variety of cultures that are present. Due to this, there are a wide variety of restaurants in Canada that are hugely popular and have created a benchmark in the <span style="background-color: yellow;"><strong>F&B industry</strong></span>. However, the last few years have had a big impact on the restaurant business. The major reason has been the pandemic, which has now existed for a couple of years now. Due to it, people feared going out to a restaurant and having their favourite meal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sales in restaurants started going down quickly and as a result, many of them had to shut down completely. However, a few of them understood and evaluated the conditions in such a way that it turned out to be a boon for them and they have converted it into an opportunity. Many branded restaurants like <span style="background-color: yellow;">Dhruvees by Wingell Hospitality, The Hakka Club Saint Barbara, The Hakka Club Argentia, and Desi Bar & Grill</span> have <strong>used the Digital Marketing strategy from Fielmente hospitality marketing agency, India</strong> to make the most of the situation and still remain in the picture, even if people were unable to go out for dining.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the last few years, the strategy of attracting more customers has completely changed. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Where the F&B industry was more reliant on physical and word-of-mouth promotions in the past, they have now started approaching potential customers through digital mediums. It is where Digital Marketing has been the most powerful tool for the segment to connect with people and place themselves as a brand.</span>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Digital Marketing keeps the business in focus or of relevance by making sure that it is active on social media and gaining more followers.</li>
      <li>Regular updates on the website and optimizing it in a way so that it ranks higher on the search engines every time.</li>
      <li>Increasing the online presence of the business using various platforms</li>
      <li>Providing more ways to contact the restaurant and increasing their online business at times when offline business is low.</li>
      <li>Increasing the interaction with the customer by getting their feedback, views, and reviews through various modes like E-mail, Social Media, survey forms, and more.</li>
      <li>Using Influencer marketing on social media websites and platforms.</li>
      <li>Network and Associate with other local businesses to increase the business network.</li>
      <li>Email Marketing to let the customers know about the latest discounts and new offerings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How these restaurants are making the most out of the business using Digital Marketing</h2>

    <p>
      One of the major reasons why restaurants like Dhruvees, The Hakka Club Saint Barbara, The Hakka Club Argentia, Desi Bar & Grill have been able to make the most out of their business using digital marketing is because of representing them as a brand. It is one thing that is common among all of them. They have used digital marketing tools to make sure that their restaurant comes out as a brand, which would eventually lead to a brand loyal following. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Since people have been spending more time online during the pandemic, especially on social media websites, it has become the perfect platform to connect with customers and let them know</span> about the restaurants near them
    </p>

    <p>
      It leads to more and more companies coming online and increasing their presence on social media platforms to stay highlighted every time. The same strategy was also used by the restaurants where they focused on increasing their presence on these social media websites and also through their own website. Using the digital marketing tools they were able to create a better and more engaging website for themselves which increased the customer interaction and also promoted them as a self-sufficient brand. Similarly, the restaurants became more active on social media websites, through their pages and advertisements, which made sure that they came as the top results in relevant searches. Here are a few things and strategies that were used by all these restaurants in Canada to promote their business.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Image:</strong> Instagram Page of The Hakka Club Saint Barbara</p>

    <h2>Visual Appeal</h2>

    <p>
      Food that looks good, makes you hungry and tempts it even more. It is one strategy that these restaurants have used to attract more customers. If you look at the <span style="background-color: yellow;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thehakkaclub_saintbarbara/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></span> page of The Hakka Club Saint Barbara, you will find that it has various pictures of their recipes. These images have been edited in a way that looks a lot more tempting and delicious, which automatically attracts the customer to want and try their food. The same is the case with the pages on Facebook. These restaurants have been adding various posts and images of their food to attract more and more customers to try it. Similar things can be done on the website as well, where it is regularly updated with new content and attractive images of the food delivered by the restaurant.
    </p>

    <h2>Online Delivery</h2>

    <p>
      Digital Marketing has helped these restaurants in the online delivery of their food as well. Even if the customers are not willing to visit the restaurant due to pandemic precautions, they can still order their food online. With the help of Digital marketing, these restaurants were able to create engaging websites which allowed them to order the food directly without any hassle. The navigation on the website has made it easy for people to check the menu and order directly. Similarly, the same online delivery promotions were used to inform people about online deliveries at their doorstep and the discounts one can avail of from that. Through Digital Marketing, their restaurant was able to convey a message to the customers that even if they are unable to visit the restaurant, they can relish the same taste from their home. One of such examples that restaurants have adopted is the delivery of food in a fixed and promised time.
    </p>

    <h2>Expanding the Network</h2>

    <p>
      Digital marketing not only helps to set up the restaurant as a brand but also helps them to increase their network of business which would further help them in earning revenue. Through Digital marketing, restaurant owners can strategize with other small business owners in the area and use affiliate relationships to increase their business. For example, guest posting on each other's blogs and recommending the restaurant services is one such way of increasing the network. Another example is that you can connect with a local hotel, which can recommend the restaurant on their website and social media page with discounts.
    </p>

    <h2>High Online Engagement with Blogs</h2>

    <p>
      Blogs are one of the best mediums through which you can get reviews and feedback from users. Through Digital Marketing, the engagement on these blogs is kept high, which helps in increasing the community who are brand loyal to the restaurant. Similarly, the restaurant can update the website and blog regularly so that people are able to see something new every time they visit it. It can be an offer, discount, scheme, introduction of a new recipe, and much more. Digital marketing keeps the community involved to increase their engagement and also increase their referrals to others.
    </p>

    <h2>Improving the Local SEO</h2>

    <p>
      You might have often searched for a restaurant near your home or office, with the words, "Restaurant near me". The results that you get from the search show you the most popular restaurants in the area that are close to you. This is what we call Local SEO. Improving the search parameters through Local SEO is one of the best ways to bring customers to the restaurant organically. It is one of the most important steps to attract the customer and something which all the popular restaurants mentioned above have done. Using Local SEO, whenever a person will search online for a restaurant nearby, the restaurant will mark the top place among the search results.
    </p>

    <h2>Verdict</h2>

    <p>
      These are some of the major digital marketing techniques followed by restaurants like Dhruvees, The Hakka Club Saint Barbara, The Hakka Club Argentia, Desi Bar & Grill, and a lot more. It has not only helped them in their offline restaurant business but has also helped them to build their brand image among people. As a result, they now have a much bigger fan following for their food and they could connect with the customers anytime through the online platform. It has not only helped the restaurants build a larger base, but also helped them to stay connected with the customers, no matter what the situation is.

Whether it’s competing with chains, attracting business travelers and vacationers, or just getting people to stop in for lunch, there are lots of factors to consider. Luckily, the rise of social media has given small businesses an easy way to get their messages out into the world. This post shares some ways that you can use social media marketing strategies to drive traffic and make more money at your establishment.
    </p>

    <h2>What is hotel & restaurant marketing through social media?</h2>

    <p>
      Recently, more restaurants are opening around the globe, making certain areas hotspots for foodie tourism. Not to mention ghost kitchens are giving tough competition to the traditional restaurants and hotels. Enforcing them indirectly to implement restaurant and restaurant performance marketing through social media.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast to more traditional hospitality marketing strategies such as yellow pages and newspaper ads, social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have played a significant role. The use of social media has enabled businesses to reach a huge audience across the globe while also providing a cost-effective method of promoting their products and services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Put simply, growing a hotel or restaurant through digital marketing is the process of using popular social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Where it becomes easier to attract potential customers by sharing key visuals of beverages, foods, and affordable services to build a social standing in the market. Let's learn more about Instagram and Facebook marketing in depth.
    </p>

    <h2>Importance of Facebook and Instagram ads in 2022</h2>

    <p>
      We are living in a time where social media has become so integrated into our modern lives that it has become an essential part of daily life. This is evident by its increasing global popularity as well as its almost constant connectivity with people from all regions on Earth. At the moment there are over four billion users on Facebook and 1.5 billion active users on Instagram.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence, over the next few years, we will see even more Instagram and Facebook usage with the continued growth of ad spending in these areas. This is largely due to their popularity among younger demographics. The ability to reach people from a much wider demographic range such as children and teens through social media ads is what drives their usage.
    </p>

    <h2>An integral part of the social media ecosystem</h2>

    <p>
      Social media has become an enormous business that is worth billions of dollars every year. There are many different kinds of businesses that use Facebook and Instagram to promote their brands by creating or sharing content with their followers. They post photos and videos, share news and events, ask for feedback or use giveaways to involve their followers in their brand's life.
    </p>

    <h2>More conversions with better outreach</h2>

    <p>
      To increase business outcomes, it’s important to reach as many potential clients as possible as quickly as possible while also making sure that they become more loyal customers over time. More than 60% of individuals complete their purchases within a day of their initial interaction with the social ad. Because these advertisements are designed to generate interactions that actually lead to sales.
    </p>

    <h2>Increase food orders based on community feelings</h2>

    <p>
      One advantage that makes Facebook and Instagram promotions so effective is that they generate community-oriented feelings. This makes it easy for people to establish relationships with brands through their photos, posts, and videos. Additionally, this allows users to feel as though they know a brand, which can ultimately lead to more food orders and the sharing of information.
    </p>

    <h2>Best for businesses with kitchen marketing needs</h2>

    <p>
      As more people use social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram on a daily basis, businesses largely focused on the kitchen industry can gain from capitalizing on these opportunities. Businesses that engage in product marketing and advertising on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, in particular, can reap huge rewards by capitalizing on their rising audiences.
    </p>

    <h2>How to get the most out of your paid social ad campaigns?</h2>

    <p>
      The answer to this question largely depends on the type of business you are running. For instance, if you are in charge of a restaurant or hotel, there is a different set of tactics than if your business is in the clothing industry. That being said, there are attributes that most successful social ads have in common and we’ve compiled some advice below to help you reach your goals.
    </p>

    <ol>

      <li>
        <strong>Automate the marketing process</strong>
        <p>
          If you are looking to create campaigns that are more effective, one of the best ways to do this is to improve the automation of your process. By adhering to a well-defined campaign process, you will be able to repeat it for each campaign and be able to increase effectiveness across all types of campaigns. This is because recurring campaigns require less testing and creative direction. And can help you supercharge your hospitality performance marketing activities more effectively.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Using visually attractive media</strong>
        <p>
          The success of such ads depends on the quality of creativity that is used. To be effective the images and text must be aligned with the company's brand messaging, target audience, and product or service. It is vital to ensure that all of these elements are clearly defined before, during, and after the campaign. If a marketer has clear goals for their campaign and understands how it fits in with their business model then they'll be more likely to connect with audience members.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Promote hotel branding with logo and blogs</strong>
        <p>
          By definition, hotels represent a high standard of luxury and attention to detail. They are synonymous with leisure and comfort, featuring luxurious amenities and superior facilities that are perfect for business travelers or holidaymakers alike. Therefore, utilizing your restaurant logo and brand value combined, can create an everlasting first impression on every new customer. On top of that, you can boost the growth by starting a blog for restaurant marketing where people can read reviews and get a better understanding of your services.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Adding cloud kitchen marketing to the campaigns</strong>
        <p>
          Cloud kitchens are being used by marketers to help create a new customer experience while creating a new revenue stream. The technology gives marketers the ability to start a virtual cloud kitchen hassle-free. And with new cooking tools and appliances, marketers can test-run recipes and track sales data in real-time. Not to mention the hotel logo plays an essential role in such situations when you don't have a physical storefront.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>

        <p>

The more defined your strategy, the clearer it will be for everyone involved in creating ads so that they understand how their efforts fit into the bigger picture.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Regular tracking of campaigns</strong>
        <p>
          To ensure the campaign continues to run successfully, you will also want to keep track of your campaigns. This can be easily done from the ad campaigns dashboard of the platform that allows you to view analytics on results and performance.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Follow audience interests</strong>
        <p>
          Trying different hotel marketing solutions may seem like a difficult task but it's totally worth it when you compare the results. Start by paying more attention to user-generated content (images, short videos, etc).
        </p>
      </li>

    </ol>

So, keep an eye out for potential partners, individuals of interest, and potential future workers in your network and through LinkedIn's automated suggestions.

      If you discover someone interesting, you may send them a personal message to start a discussion. You can ask for an introduction from a mutual friend if you have one.

    <h2>Catering</h2>

    <p>
      Catering is one of the most common ways to extend a <strong>restaurant agency</strong>. This may be highly useful to your bottom line if you are located in a large city. Caterers may make a lot of money by catering weddings, conferences, parties, and other events. People are familiar with your meals if you have a well-known <strong>restaurant branding</strong>.

You can evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of several solutions and decide if catering is something you want to try.
    </p>

    <h2>Service of Delivery</h2>

    <p>
      Offering delivery service is a simple way to add a new dimension to your <strong>restaurant agency</strong>. Even if you're a sit-down restaurant, there are ways to get your menu items to your customers. Begin by delivering only a small number of menu items in a given location. If you discover a need for this service, you may expand your service area and hire more delivery drivers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Offering delivery services might help your business by providing a second cash stream. Consider your location and whether or not this is realistic. Before starting a delivery service with your <strong>restaurant marketing</strong>, there are a few things to think about. Take notes to evaluate whether this is a viable solution for your company.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating new dining locations</h2>

    <p>
      Opening a new eating place would be a great way to expand. Maybe your <strong>marketing strategy for a restaurant</strong> is in a huge metropolis, and you'd like to expand into the next town over. If there is a demand, you can locate a good site, and you have the time and energy to start a new venue, this might be helpful.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the most expensive expansion, but it may also be the most lucrative. Do your research if you're thinking of launching a new <strong>restaurant agency</strong>. Investigate the region you're contemplating, scout places, conduct diner surveys, etc. You want to know if the choice will help you achieve rather than be a waste of time and money.
    </p>

    <h2>You have a sturdy and dependable squad on your side</h2>

    <p>
      If you have a stable and dependable staff of hardworking individuals, managing the growth of your restaurant will be much easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please remember that if you're planning an expansion, the greatest thing you can do is collaborate with your most dependable personnel and cycle between the restaurants.
    </p>

    <p>
      They can also provide you with useful information on what guests are saying and how they feel about the service and business.
    </p>

    <h2>Join in the conversation</h2>

    <p>
      Join groups to initiate discussions, and don't limit yourself to <strong>restaurant branding</strong> or <strong>cloud kitchen marketing</strong>. If you start discussions in these groups yourself, make sure they're worthwhile. This will pique people's interest in your company and persuade them to learn more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Encourage your staff to create LinkedIn profiles so that they may contribute to your marketing efforts by sharing material and participating in discussions. Make sure they put your restaurant as their place of employment since this will help you grow organically.
    </p>

    <h2>The demand has grown</h2>

    <p>
      It's a sign that you should grow your business if your customers tell you that you need additional restaurants or that you need to build more stores.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consumers may believe they must travel a great distance to reach your restaurant. You may need to construct a second restaurant in a key area. Maybe your customers say this because your restaurant's capacity is currently limited, or maybe they think it's such a nice thing to say.
    </p>

    <h2>Quality and consistency</h2>

    <p>
      Customers will come to your second <strong>restaurant agency</strong> because of the success of your first restaurant and the brand name, but only exceptional cuisine and service will keep them there. Maintaining consistency and quality across all stores is essential when running a restaurant chain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recipe standardization is critical for maintaining the food's taste and quality. When it comes to long-chain restaurants, brand image is crucial to their success. A consistent format and menu help to maintain the brand's image.
    </p>

    <h2>Publicize Your Company's News</h2>

    <p>
      If you have a large event, are establishing a new restaurant in your chain, have reached an agreement on a new financial relationship, or have any other good news to communicate about your <strong>restaurant agency</strong>, post a link to a press release about it on your newsfeed.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll quickly have users interested in what you have to say and commenting on any news you post if you lay the groundwork to establish your network.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertise</h2>

    <p>
      There is also the possibility to promote on LinkedIn if you start to have some success on the network through organic means. LinkedIn ads may be used to reach out to potential business partners, new investors, or potential sponsors for an upcoming event.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might also try to target people searching for a location to rent for Christmas parties or those planning weddings and want a pre-wedding dinner celebration. To ensure that you reach the proper individuals, you may divide your advertising by industry, firm size, geography, and title.
    </p>

    <p>
      LinkedIn is a terrific tool for growing your reputation within an industry, communicating with people in your sector, and connecting with folks who might provide value to your business, even if it doesn’t create a lot of online reservations for your restaurant.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may build a loyal following and a buzz about your restaurant. It improves the exposure of what you're trying to do daily in your business, and possibly some outside investment, by working hard at it.
    </p>

    <h2>Your company can function even if you are not present</h2>

    <p>
      At this point, your company must have enough operational processes in place to ensure that it runs smoothly. For a successful business to run well, the owner or the person in control does not need to be there. Its personnel must understand their responsibilities and how to react in various situations.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's also a good idea to automate your restaurant to familiarize your employees with all of the procedures. This saves time and effort. For instance, as a restaurant owner, you may automate culinary operations, waiter communication with customers, and digital and content marketing activities, among other things.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      Analytics is one of the most beneficial features of utilizing LinkedIn's <strong>marketing strategy for restaurants</strong>. LinkedIn's statistics are comprehensive and user-friendly, allowing you to assess the impact of your efforts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many <strong>restaurant agency</strong> operators use LinkedIn as part of their social media strategy. Beyond the typical Facebook marketing options, restaurants discover that LinkedIn is a terrific way to spread the word and cultivate customer loyalty. Consider these or other choices for expanding your business to continue to see it grow and prosper.

    <h2>How to grow your hotel and restaurant business through digital marketing?</h2>

    <p>

Moreover, it includes increasing the engagement ratio with potential customers to convert them into returning ones. So let's go through the efficient yet reliable ways for growing your hotel or restaurant successfully in 2022 with digital marketing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Getting more exposure on the internet by having</strong> a professional website for your hotel or restaurant is the first step to growth in the digital world. However, simply creating a website doesn't mean that you will start receiving tons of orders and calls right away! And the sole reason why it won't happen is that no one is aware of your business online.
    </p>

    <p>
      So the best solution for gaining more exposure on the internet is to promote your website while implementing the different digital marketing methods that we have discussed. Not to mention, you need a live and professional website for this method.
    </p>

    <h3>Utilizing social media platforms</h3>

    <p>
      One of the most effective ways to grow your restaurant or hotel with digital marketing is by connecting with your customers on different social media platforms. Social media platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook offer a wide range of filters and features to help a business target their customers more effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      With access to these features, you can instantly spread the word about any new products, dishes, or ongoing discounts to encourage new customers visually. What makes this more preferred is the fact that you don't need to spend a fortune for hiring marketing agencies or running ad campaigns.
    </p>

    <h3>Effective email marketing campaigns</h3>

    <p>
      For many people, email is the “it” way to communicate. It’s ubiquitous, it’s frequent, and it flows straight from your fingertips to the screen of someone who wants to consume it. Fortunately, restaurants and hotels looking to turn visitors into loyal customers via email marketing, have some powerful tools at their disposal. By which it gets a lot easier to create high converting personalized email campaigns that improve your brand presence as well. You can get professional help with tools like Aweber instantly.
    </p>

    <h3>Accurate Influencer marketing</h3>

    <p>
      Having an influencer market your hotel or restaurant can be quite useful with the right approach. But, how can you find people who would be willing to do influencer marketing for you? Well, there are some social media sites that you can use to find these people and hopefully give you a return on the investment. One of them is Upfluence.com. They have a perk that allows you to search for influencers by topic and location, even better than that it also allows you to narrow down your search based on specific interests so that your marketing doesn't fall on deaf ears.
    </p>

    <h3>Paying attention to testimonials</h3>

    <p>
      As a restaurant or hotel owner, it is essential to have reviews from different audiences and sources. Reviews are also important for faster growth in the hospitality industry because reviews generate business. Therefore, the most effective way to grow your hotel or restaurant is by having reviews from visitors.
    </p>

    <p>
      On top of that, it is highly recommended to keep checking on the reviews regularly. Because in some cases people are known to post fake reviews just to bring down the reputation of a certain business. So make sure to get rid of those spammy reviews before they start affecting your growth.
    </p>

    <h3>Never ignore local SEO</h3>

    <p>
      With local SEO, there is a different approach to determining which businesses appear in local SERPs than with conventional (or “organic”) results. Instead of looking at relevance, Google looks at the local intent.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if you live in London and search for “best restaurants in London,” Google will show you the top-rated and most popular eateries in your area. Therefore, It’s important to note that working on your local SEO can drive more customers and sales as the competition is low.
    </p>

    <h3>Emerge as a trustworthy brand</h3>

    <p>
      Emerging as a trustworthy brand in the internet world will attract a lot of potential customers and spread the word more easily. Because Branding is important because it creates something that distinguishes your business from the competition. It creates a look, feels, and public perception that will turn people into repeat customers. Focus on what sets you apart: As a new restaurant or hotel brand you probably won't have the funding to compete with the big players at first but that is okay because finding your niche and being the best at it, is more important.
    </p>

    <h3>Promote your business through paid ads</h3>

    <p>
      As for the last method on this list, growing your business with targeted ad campaigns can be quite effective. Since every restaurant and hotel has different needs, it is important to tailor messages to customers depending on their needs. You can start with popular platforms such as Google Adwords or Facebook to have more control over the ad spend and customizations. Plus, it would be wise to geotarget your audience based on their recent interests to get the most out of your paid ad campaigns.
    </p>

    <h2>Things to keep in mind before implementing digital marketing</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Never invest in digital marketing campaigns or related activities without knowing your target audience.</li>
      <li>Since most restaurants are customer-centric, it is important to develop strategies that will attract their target market which in this case are customers.</li>
      <li>A hotel/restaurant should be able to adapt campaigns relevant to its intended customer base.</li>
      <li>Larger companies may benefit from using multiple restaurants to spread out their investment cost and reduce any possible losses when implementing new business strategies.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, a restaurant should ensure that the company’s size matches the level of digital marketing they want to deploy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Verdict</h2>

    <p>
      In summary, digital marketing is dependent on the company’s size and its area of focus since large companies can easily afford the high costs of implementing online marketing methods successfully, on the contrary, startups may find it difficult to allocate extra budget for it. But we recommend estimating the overall cost for the whole process to ensure it fits into the business's budget goals. In addition, tracking your progress and customer count is a good practice to see whether your efforts and money are flowing in the right direction or not.

    <p>
      Restaurant owners who optimize their websites for search engine optimization are more likely to be at the top of a Google search results page than those who do not invest in SEO. A prime ranking on Google can mean an increase in organic traffic, which can lead to increased revenue! Restaurant or hotel owners who rely on word-of-mouth advertising will find that online advertising makes it much easier to reach more people at less cost. So let's discuss some reasons why you should invest your time and resources into SEO as a restaurant owner.
    </p>

    <h2>What is SEO for restaurants?</h2>

    <p>
      SEO for restaurants is a term that contains many different aspects. It may seem like it is difficult to understand and implement, but there are countless hotel marketing solutions and restaurant marketing companies in India, that can provide you with a variety of affordable SEO packages.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first step in getting quality SEO for your restaurant would be to evaluate your needs, goals, strengths, weaknesses, and resources. Once you have this list set up, you will be able to find the perfect package that suits all of these categories. Secondly, while SEO is essential for restaurants and businesses alike; it is not always necessary or affordable if other strategies are put into motion before SEO is implemented.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, if you have been relying on TV ads or physical mediums such as flyers and posters, they cost a lot of fortune. Wasting your money on them before moving to SEO isn't a wise choice at all. But why a restaurant or hotel owner should shift to digital marketing in 2022? Let's take a look at the big picture and understand why it is worth investing in better SEO for your restaurant.
    </p>

    <h2>Is it worth investing in better SEO?</h2>

    <p>
      This is one of the first questions that comes to hotel owners' minds, "Should I really invest in a new marketing strategy?". And it is completely normal when someone is not aware of the potential results and business growth with SEO. With so many doubts and questions regarding the new hospitality marketing concept, getting help from a professional hotel marketing agency is way better than spending hours on YouTube to get started from scratch.
    </p>

    <p>
      No doubt, hospitality performance marketing is one of the most common methods of gaining an initial customer base. But it's only effective when your requirements are crystal clear. This can help you get the most out of your digital marketing campaigns or organic traffic generation efforts through SEO. But why you should pay for getting a better SEO for your business? Keep reading to find out!
    </p>

    <h2>Top 10 reasons why SEO is essential for restaurants</h2>

    <ol>

      <li>
        <strong>Rank higher for local results</strong>
        <p>
          Local SEO has been a topic that receives much attention in recent years, as more people continue to take advantage of mobile technology. Using Google Maps, people can find restaurants simply by searching for their names throughout their area.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also increases brand recognition for restaurants by helping add customers to your restaurants’ Facebook pages or websites through your smartphone. So with the right SEO, your restaurant can pop up in the search results which will help you gain more orders on a local level.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Significant growth in orders</strong>
        <p>
          Once the customer is on your page, it's just a matter of time until the visually attractive media encourages them to place an order. However, it is only possible when your hotel or restaurant is easily found by the potential customers who wish to order food or make advance bookings for a room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, the SEO agency will optimize your page so that it is easy to navigate and easily recognizable by a customer. So when someone looks up on Google "Restaurant near me", Google will display your business in the top positions due to the accurate SEO.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Impressive restaurant branding</strong>
        <p>
          Successful restaurant SEO services help improve the brand value of a restaurant or hotel. If your business ranks high on search engines, people will be more likely to trust you and visit your place of work. Not to mention using a unique and attractive hotel logo design will help you stand out more. Whereas, an appealing logo will help new customers remember your hotel branding with accuracy. And if restaurants and hotels in your area are not working on these aspects, you are more likely to get better results with the help of branding.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Benefit from restaurant listings</strong>
        <p>
          Ranking high on Google maps earns you a spot in their business directories. This can be used as an additional resource for promoting your business via social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, or through digital marketing displaying specials or upcoming events for customers to see during their visits.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly, holding onto the top positions on such lists is a little difficult without the right SEO guidance and growth hacks.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Stealing your competitor’s audience</strong>
        <p>
          If you have a restaurant then there maybe be a lot of restaurants or hotels that give you a hard time finding new returning customers. Because customers searching for the same products or services will search in different locations. And if the place is already crowded with similar businesses, the competition will increase automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where the SEO service kicks in to help you keep your customers coming back. Plus, they help you rank higher on Google local searches as well as target people's interests to get people to visit your restaurant over your competition.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Bookings made quick and simple</strong>
        <p>
          Once customers are on a search engine page with information about you and your services, they can easily book an appointment by clicking a link or calling you directly on the provided contact details. This allows them to make a reservation for their visit without having to drive across town or wait until they arrive at your establishment.
        </p>
        <p>

    <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
