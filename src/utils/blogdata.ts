<p>The hospitality landscape in Noida is about to witness a major shift. The Uttar Pradesh government has rolled out the Bed and Breakfast (BnB) and Homestay Policy 2025, bringing much-needed legitimacy and structure to guest accommodation facilities that have so far been operating informally.</p>
<p>
This landmark move opens new doors for property owners, offering not just legality but also financial incentives, promotional support, and training opportunities to help them thrive in the rapidly growing tourism sector.</p>

<h2>What the New Policy Means for Homeowners</h2>

<p>The policy creates a clear framework that distinguishes between homestays and BnBs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only legal property owners can apply. Leased or rented properties are not eligible.</li>
	<li>One certificate per building is allowed, covering up to six rooms or 12 beds.</li>
	<li>Caretakers permitted: In cases where the owner doesn’t live on-site, a caretaker can manage the facility.</li>
	<li>Mandatory registration: All applications must be submitted online at up-tourismportal.in, with approval granted within 30 days after verification and inspection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Categories, Fees, and Facility Standards</h2>

<p>To encourage participation, the policy offers a tiered classification system:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Silver Units</li>
	<li>Minimum 120 sq. ft. rooms</li>
	<li>Registration fee: ₹2,000</li>
	<li>Gold Units</li>
	<li>Must include AC, TV, fridge, geyser, and attached bathrooms (200 sq. ft. minimum room size)</li>
	<li>Registration fee: ₹3,000</li>
	<li>Dormitories/Homestays</li>
	<li>Fee: ₹100 per room</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, CCTV installation is mandatory, with recordings to be preserved for 90 days.</p>

<h2>Benefits Beyond Legality</h2>

<p>Officials highlight that the policy not only formalizes the sector but also supports homeowners with added income opportunities. Among the incentives:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Eligibility for subsidies under Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, helping property owners reduce power costs.</li>
	<li>Skill training for up to eight support staff members.</li>
	<li>Promotional visibility on the state’s tourism development portal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Suresh Raina, District Tourism Officer for Noida and Ghaziabad, remarked:</h2>

<p>“This is an excellent opportunity for residents to turn a portion of their homes into tourist-ready spaces. It not only provides income but also connects families with global travelers, bringing direct benefits from government training, concessions, and promotion.”</p>

<h2>A Welcome Move for the Hospitality Sector</h2>

<p>Industry leaders have welcomed the decision, noting that legalizing BnBs will enhance visitor trust while giving homeowners more financial stability. Vishesh Tyagi, President of the Paying Guest House Owners’ Welfare Association of Noida, commented that the move could unlock fresh opportunities, especially during international trade shows, exhibitions, and large-scale official events.</p>

<p>With well-regulated BnBs now set to operate legally, both homeowners and tourists stand to gain — homeowners from increased revenue and government incentives, and tourists from safe, verified, and comfortable stays.</p>

<h3>Final Word</h3>

<p>The BnB and Homestay Policy 2025 marks a turning point for Noida’s hospitality sector. By shifting informal guest accommodations into a regulated, incentive-driven framework, the government is not only fostering tourism growth but also empowering homeowners to become part of the city’s evolving travel ecosystem.<p>

<p>For homeowners in Noida, this is the perfect moment to explore hosting — legally, profitably, and sustainably.</p>

    <p>In today’s hyper-competitive hospitality landscape, hotels across the United States are seeking smarter, cost-effective, and results-driven ways to attract guests, increase bookings, and boost their digital presence. Surprisingly, many of these hotels are turning to Fielmente, a hospitality marketing agency based in India, to achieve their goals.

	<li>Leveraging Google Hotels & Meta ads</li>
	<li>Building brand visibility on social media</li>
	<li>Enhancing online reputation through reviews</li></ul>

  <p>For American hotels, this niche expertise is often more valuable than hiring a local generalist agency.</p>

	<li>SEO and content marketing</li>
	<li>Advanced automation tools</li></ul>

      <p>All without compromising on quality.</p>


      <h2>3. 24/7 Global Reach</h2>

      <p>The time zone difference between India and the U.S. actually works to hotels’ advantage. With Fielmente’s team operating ahead of U.S. business hours, campaign execution, reporting, and optimization can be done overnight, ensuring faster turnaround times and continuous progress.</p>

⸻

    <h2>4. Proven Track Record With International Hotels</h2>

    <p>Fielmente has worked with resorts, boutique hotels, chains, and luxury properties worldwide, offering tailored marketing strategies that deliver measurable results. U.S. hotels gain from these tried-and-tested approaches without needing to reinvent the wheel.</p>

    <ul>
	    <li>AI booking chatbots</li>
	    <li>WhatsApp & email automation</li>
	    <li>Channel manager integrations</li>
	    <li>Social media dashboards</li>
      </ul>
    <p>This technology-first approach ensures that hotels in the U.S. stay ahead of digital trends, offering guests a seamless booking experience.</p>


    <h2>6. Cultural Understanding of Global Travelers<h2>

    <p>India’s diverse hospitality market has prepared Fielmente to understand the preferences of varied guest demographics, from millennials to luxury seekers. This cultural adaptability enables the agency to design campaigns that resonate with both domestic U.S. travelers and international tourists.</p>


    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

    <p>For U.S. hotels, hiring Fielmente isn’t just about outsourcing marketing—it’s about gaining a strategic partner who combines industry expertise, cost efficiency, and global hospitality insights.</p>

    <p>At a time when attracting and retaining guests is more competitive than ever, Fielmente provides U.S. hotels with the tools, strategies, and creativity they need to thrive in a digital-first world.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Google reviews are necessary for any local business,</b> as
      73% of users search for online reviews, and consumers are
      twice as likely to search for new local businesses on
      Google.
    </p>
    <p>
      Replying to customers or customer feedback can be tricky,
      but it doesn’t have to be. This blog is to help you avoid
      common mistakes that could fuel negative word-of-mouth and
      make it difficult to attract new customers. Let us see how
      creatively you can reply to google reviews and facebook
      feedback.
    </p>
  
    <div>
      <h2>Why Are Reviews Important?</h2>
      <p>
        It is a legitimate question because the most formidable
        weapon against errors of every kind is reason! Reviews
        for any business are crucial for three main reasons, and
        let’s look at each one of them now.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The <b>first</b> is to get new customers. Every business needs
        new customers for growth and revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a scenario where a customer is looking for a
        cake shop to buy a cake, and he comes across two shops.
      </p>
      <p>Shop A has ten reviews with a 4.3 rating out of 5</p>
      <p>Shop B has six reviews with a 3.1 rating out of 5</p>
      <p>
        The person will probably choose Shop A as it has better
        Google reviews. He is among those 57% of consumers who
        only opt for businesses with a higher rating (4 or
        above).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have been avoiding reviews, this example should
        help you do otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that if your shop or business has fewer reviews,
        new customers might not even find your business in the
        first place. And you certainly DO NOT want that!
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Local SEO Guide, “The prominence of review
        isn’t particularly shocking, as it’s a way for Google to
        crowdsource ranking factors, it’s hard to spam, and the
        most problematic type of abuse is illegal.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The <b>second</b> reason is that reviews boost your business’s
        local SEO. You might already know Google’s proximity
        factor for filtering local search results. Good reviews
        are the factors that impact Google’s search results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s an easy example for you to understand. Imagine
        you are in a new city looking for the best store to buy
        a new dress. When you search in Google for the same, you
        will have options closest to you. But if a shop has
        better ratings than the one closest to you, Google will
        recommend that shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Managing your online reputation and brand visibility
        will help you reach potential customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are wondering why Google produces such results,
        the main reason is to provide the best results against
        your searches and reviews.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The <b>third</b> reason is that reviews are an opportunity to
        get better! Organizations usually conduct customer
        satisfaction surveys to know how customers feel about
        their products and services! Reviews are the same. You
        get positive, neutral, and negative comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        So engage with the reviews and take full advantage of
        the opportunity.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Why do we need to reply to Google reviews?</h2>
      <p>
        Google ranks those businesses that are reliable and
        trustworthy. As Google wants to provide the best result
        to a search query, it looks for quality also.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we respond to Google reviews, we help Google see us
        as a trustworthy place of business, boosting our
        credibility online and offline.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also greatly affects local SEO. So, if you have
        Google reviews, then make sure you reply to them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>How to Respond to Positive Google Reviews?</h2>
      <p>
        Positive reviews make you happy and keep you motivated.
        Customers love your business, and they tell their
        friends about it. So, you must acknowledge your
        delighted customers by replying to their positive
        feedback. The following ways will help you create that
        bond between your ‘happy’ customer and you.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Personalise the review:</h3>
      <p>
        When replying, personalise it using the person’s name,
        mention the product, and emphasise thanking them.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Timely response:</h3>
      <p>
        Respond quickly to the feedback if possible. The
        customer has gone out of their way to leave a review.
        Your responses promptly create a good impression and
        sense of acknowledgement for the customer.
      </p>
      <h3>3. State your happiness:</h3>
      <p>
        Construct your reply to show you are happy to help/serve
        them and appreciate them taking their time to share a
        review.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Match reviewers’ energy:</h3>
      <p>
        Try to respond in the same energy band as a customer.
        For example, if the customer has responded with
        enthusiasm, be sure to respond to him with great energy.

        Acknowledge and thank the reviewer: I appreciate the
        customer’s taking the time to write a review.
        Acknowledge that you have seen the feedback.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>1. Emphasise:</h3>
      <p>
        Emphasise the valid points from the customer’s review.
        If they have a valid point or reason, assure them their
        changes will be done soon and take the necessary action
        to improve your product or service.

      <br />
      <h3>2. Turn a Neutral review into a positive:</h3>
      <p>
        If your customer has written a neutral review, try to

        These are a few things to keep in mind while responding
        to negative feedback:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take your time for assessment:</li>
        <li>
          Do not panic, and take your time to understand and
          review the issue the customer faced.
        </li>
        <li>Check if it was your fault or not.</li>
        <li>Try to come up with a solution.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>1. Acknowledge and be apologetic:</h3>
      <p>
        Acknowledge the customer’s review. Apologies and let
        them know you have read the review, value your
        customers’ opinions, and apologies for their bad
        experience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>2. Ask for contact details:</h3>
      <p>
        Ask them for their contact details to share with

        Best Tips or strategies you should follow while replying
        to negative reviews
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Be polite and professional in your reply. Any impolite
          response will reflect negatively on your part.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid showing your emotions. It is not about how you
          are feeling. It is about your customer’s experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apologies to the customer, but only if it is
          necessary. Focus on the fact that your customer is not
          happy. Empathise with the customer and make them feel
          heard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure it is productive and restores faith in the
          customer’s mind. It will also show your potential
          customers your willingness to take action.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a customer has not mentioned the reason for their
          frustration, simply ask them but avoid taking guesses.
          Ask them to share their reason and try resolving it.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of fake reviews, please report them using the
          correct channels.

      <h2>How should we deal with fake reviews?</h2>
      <p>
        Fake reviews can seriously hurt your business
        reputation, whether good or bad. Some indicators used to
        find whether the reviews are fake or not are as follows:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>They are extremely positive or negative.</li>
        <li>
          The same way of phrasing a sentence can be seen
          throughout.
        </li>
        <li>
          They do not contain any details of the person’s
          product or service.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <p>
        In such cases, you can ask Google to review it; if the
        review goes against the guidelines, they will remove it
        for you. Also, remember to reply to the fake review. An
        example is shared below.
      </p>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hi, (Fake Customer Name),
        <br />
        We take these matters very seriously. Unfortunately, we
        have no record or recollection of your experience with
        us, nor can we verify anything about your identity from
        your name in our records.
        <br />
        We want to investigate further if you have done business
        with us. Please contact (Manager’s Name) immediately at
        (Email/Phone Number) so we can resolve this issue.

      <h2>Why do we need to reply to Facebook Feedback?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        While running a business on Facebook, you might consider
        taking your reviews seriously, as they greatly impact
        your presence on the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facebook reviews appear in your business page’s ‘Reviews
        or Recommendations section’. Compared to Google,
        Facebook can turn off the reviews, but it is recommended
        not to do it as reviews impact your potential customers,
        and it is one of the ways to establish your brand’s
        voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are running a Facebook business page, reviews
        are one of the ways of introducing and educating people
        on Facebook about your business. Managing the Facebook
        business page and working continuously to improve your
        overall public image is important.

      <p>
        As a business owner, reviewing and replying to reviews
        shared about your product or services is important.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Always address the customer by name to add a more
          personalised touch to your comment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Acknowledge the review and thank the customer for
          sharing their feedback. Rather than just writing
          ‘Thank you’, write a more personalised reply
          appreciating the customer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Quick replies play a major role as the customer goes
          out of their way to write and boost your public image.
          Always try to reply as quickly as possible. It makes
          customers feel wanted as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always try to retain the customers by welcoming them
          back soon. Try to do so by providing exclusive offers
          and discounts only for them.

        hospitality marketing solutions to hospitality
        businesses of all sizes.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most important reasons to have hospitality
        advisors is that they can help develop a strategic plan
        for your hotel that includes hospitality marketing
        solutions. The plan is achieved after a thorough
        understanding of your hotel’s strengths and weaknesses
        and the competitive landscape in your market.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good hospitality marketing agency will help you
        identify growth opportunities and develop strategies to
        achieve your business goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to their expertise in hospitality
        operations, hospitality advisors can also provide a
        valuable outside perspective. They can help you to
        identify areas where your hotel is falling short and
        develop solutions to improve your performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, having hospitality advisors can be a valuable
        investment for any hotel. With expert advice and
        guidance, hospitality advisors can help you improve the
        profitability and efficiency of your hotel and, in
        return, achieve your long-term business goals.

        Why is opening a cloud kitchen a good idea?
      </strong>
      <br />
      Here’s what happens exactly in a cloud kitchen model:
      Orders come in, meals are cooked, packed, and then whisked
      immediately to their delivery locations by the assigned
      fleet.
      <br />
      Why does this work?
      <b>
        Because you’re cutting costs on front-of-house
        activities and concentrating on your food.
      </b>
      With the availability of third-party services and the
      growing comfort of mobile ordering, this model seems just
      right to experiment with. There are more benefits involved
      like:
    </p>
  
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Lower real estate costs</h2>
      <p>
        Since you’re removing table servicing out of the
        equation and offering a delivery-only service, you’ll
        save a huge amount on real estate costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cloud kitchens release you from the obligation of having
        space in a high-visibility area. Rather than paying for
        accessibility, better-developed complexes, or even a
        large parking space, you can concentrate on having
        enough kitchen space in a decent area near your target
        market.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Better expansion opportunities</h2>
      <p>
        The best thing about cloud kitchens is that you don’t
        need heavy investments to begin. You can start small but
        expand fast. Once you build a brand and get loyal
        customers, expanding to new localities and even new menu
        varieties gets easier. Let’s take the example of Faasos,
        today it runs 160+ kitchens and 4 brands including
        Faasos, Behrouz Biryani, Oven Story, and Firangi Bake.

      <h3>Saving on overhead costs</h3>
      <p>
        With a cloud kitchen, you save so much on overhead
        costs. You don’t need client-facing staff, decoration or
        space entrance, parking area, etc. Even if you have
        lower-priced menu items, your profit margins are likely
        to be better.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h3>How does a cloud kitchen work?</h3>
      <p>
        Cloud kitchens are centralized licensed commercial food
        production facilities where anywhere from one or two to
        dozens of restaurants rent space to prepare
        delivery-optimized menu items. One restaurant may run
        multiple brands or virtual restaurants, all operating
        under one roof, or the kitchen may be run like an
        incubator, shared by different purveyors. Picture a
        large warehouse with numerous stations
        (mini-restaurants) of stainless steel prep tables, hood
        vents, stoves, ovens, and sinks, each with its own
        orders coming in directly from customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cloud kitchen menu items are optimized for ease of
        production and reliability of food quality upon
        delivery. Often physically located in out-of-town
        industrial complexes, cloud kitchens may offer driver
        parking, driver waiting areas (often with screens to
        monitor order times), and check-in stations for seamless
        driver pick-up. All are designed to get food out the
        door and into the customer’s hands as fast as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cloud kitchens are uniquely tech-enabled. They take
        advantage of the now ubiquitous food delivery apps on
        your smartphone, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub, and
        Doordash.
        <br /> In doing so, they use large amounts of data to
        determine what types of foods to produce for specific
        neighborhoods and when the demand is likely to be
        greatest. For example, hot wings tend to be really
        popular between 11 pm-2 am near college campuses. This
        data is fueling rapid adaptation and optimization,
        almost in real time.
        <br /> As the technology has matured, additional
        services have emerged to aggregate the various delivery
        apps into one portal, for easier production of multiple
        orders and delivery coordination as well as smart food
        purchasing and production software for decreased food
        waste and increased per-meal unit economics. We have
        only seen the tip of the iceberg of innovation in this
        space.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Competing in a crowded digital marketplace</h2>
      <p>
        With no physical location, cloud kitchens don’t benefit
        from walk-in traffic. You are competing exclusively in a
        crowded online marketplace. The good news is, if your
        product is good enough, it should rise to the top thanks
        to social proof like good reviews and word-of-mouth
        referrals. But you may find yourself having to pay for
        visibility on these platforms. That is, after all, how
        they make their money. You should be aware of this
        potential added cost, especially at the beginning,
        before you’re able to develop your own loyal following.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Food quality and food safety</h2>
      <p>
        With a delivery-only brand, your reputation relies on
        the food getting to the customer in perfect condition.
        Getting this right is the only way to get repeat orders.
        There are significant challenges in keeping the product
        at proper temperatures so it arrives as intended to the
        customer. Not just at the right temperature for them to
        best enjoy it but also to ensure it is safe to eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means testing out different types of packaging and
        potentially investing in containers that are more
        expensive and harder to source. This is a cost that can
        quickly add up when you are pumping out a high volume of
        orders, but it is a vital consideration. Soggy, lukewarm
        food will guarantee failure. And one food-borne illness
        or outbreak and your brand is toast.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Local regulation and licensure</h2>
      <p>
        Food production is largely regulated at the local level
        by your health department. Since cloud kitchens are so
        new, regulators may be unfamiliar with the concept. They
        may start hitting you with unexpected requirements, or
        start treating you like a full-service restaurant.
        <br />
        Agents will want to see that food is being safely
        stored, produced, packaged, and delivered, which may
        require the production of <b>HACCP</b> and other
        production plans for review. Also, having multiple
        tenants producing under one roof increases the
        complexity of who is licensed to produce and distribute
        food. You must be prepared to go the extra mile in
        showing them that your operation is safe and
        responsible.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>What’s behind the cloud kitchen trend?</h2>
      <p>
        Cloud kitchens started popping up in the early 2010s in
        response to increased demand for high-quality meal
        delivery and rising rents in city center locations.
        Green Summit Group opened one of the first cloud
        kitchens in New York City in 2013, and has grown out to
        four locations across two cities.
        <br /> Many more start-ups have followed suit and as we
        enter a new decade, cloud kitchens are becoming big
        business, with venture capital pouring into start-ups
        specifically aiming to take advantage of this new
        market.
        <br /> The trend is driven by the coming of age of
        millennials with disposable income demanding digital,
        mobile-friendly solutions. And this will only get more
        pronounced as the next generation, who have grown up
        with the internet and smartphones, enters the
        marketplace (sorry boomers). Looking further forward
        advances in kitchen automation, drone delivery, and the
        continued growth of the gig economy look to give cloud
        kitchens more of an advantage by lowering their costs
        even further.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Let’s take a closer look at the factors affecting the
          trend.
        </li>
        <li>Real estate prices in urban areas</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        As urban real estate prices continue their upward trend,
        delivery-only kitchens are able to take advantage of
        their ‘virtual’ nature. The only restriction on their
        location is that they must be within a realistic
        delivery distance of enough hungry customers.
        <br /> Companies like Kitchen United are focussing on
        light industrial areas outside dense urban centers but
        near enough to satisfy the demand of residential areas.
        Large warehouses at low rents are the perfect venues to
        house expansive shared kitchens if you have the capital
        to outfit them. Using demand data collected from
        delivery apps, they are able to determine the best
        locations to serve particular neighborhoods.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Increase in demand for delivery</h2>
      <p>
        Food delivery is set to grow to a $200 billion industry
        by 2025, due to shifting changes in behavior, with
        nearly half of consumers preferring to eat at home. Uber
        is even more optimistic than most, valuing the market at
        $795 billion.
        <br /> With 91 million monthly users, Uber Eats is
        currently the most popular food delivery app. Consumers
        are increasingly willing to pay a significant amount for
        the convenience of having their food delivered.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Increase in on-demand contract workers</h2>
      <p>
        With the gig or sharing economy in full swing and
        expected to hit $335 billion by 2025, we’ve seen an
        increase in on-demand contract workers. The number of
        people working as ride-share drivers, delivery drivers,
        and remote workers is on the rise, offering low-cost
        labor with no strings attached from an employer’s point
        of view. However the stability of the gig economy is
        still unknown. California recently passed a law that
        requires that some companies treat contract workers as
        employees.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>
        Emerging technologies decrease the cost of delivery
      </h2>
      <p>
        Looking further forward, drone delivery and kitchen
        automation are set to disrupt the standard restaurant
        model further. Robot kitchens are on the rise and drone
        delivery is poised to break through, with only regional
        regulations standing in its way.
        <br /> Tech-minded shared kitchens are perfectly
        positioned to take advantage of these advances. They are
        much more able and likely to adapt quickly to new
        technology, giving them a further edge over storefront
        restaurants.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Access to user data and real-time adaptability</h2>
      <p>
        Because they are designed with tech in mind, cloud
        kitchens can optimize processes, ordering, and staff
        scheduling based on consumer behavior. The menu can also
        be adapted to suit demand and increase margins,
        optimizing the model over time.
        <br /> Not being tied to a physical location means you
        can change the menu or operating times to suit business
        needs without as much of an impact on customer
        satisfaction. This can also help to decrease food waste,
        as you can be smarter with ordering and prep decisions.
        <br /> In fact, virtual restaurants are so adaptable,
        you can even launch a brand just for a season. For
        instance, you could launch a healthy salad brand for the
        summer and a hearty poutine concept for the winter
        months, allowing you to take advantage of the seasonal
        demand for each type of food without enduring any
        downturn.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>
        Digital brand awareness without high marketing spend
      </h2>
      <p>
        Virtual restaurant brands can gain quick exposure
        through delivery apps, rather than having to market
        themselves. Although a new virtual restaurant concept
        will have to pay for visibility, which is part of the
        delivery app business model, this can still work out
        cheaper overall, especially if you are creative about
        building your brand.

    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>
        What are the potential challenges with ghost kitchens?
      </h2>
      <p>
        With any new technology, there are going to be certain
        drawbacks along with the benefits. Here are some of the
        potential challenges that come with running a cloud
        kitchen.
        <br /> Working with on-demand staff running a cloud
        kitchen, you may be more inclined to hire on-demand
        staff to control margins. While this can save on your
        wage bill, it comes with some caveats. Since staff won’t
        be interacting with guests or getting tips, it could
        feel more like working in a factory than a hospitality
        job. Of course, you can try to boost morale and motivate
        staff in other ways, but it may be more difficult to
        build a brand culture if you are not attracting the top
        food service talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hiring on-demand staff also carries risks in terms of
        food safety and consistency, both vital to successful
        food businesses. Can you be sure these workers have
        adequate training? If you want to invest in training, it
        makes more sense to hire permanent staff members. There
        is a trade-off here that you will have to work on to try
        to figure out the best balance between on-demand workers
        and permanent staff.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Reliance on third-party delivery apps</h2>
      <p>
        For all the benefits of using delivery apps, it’s never
        a good business decision to rely on one source of
        customers. The high fees can also eat into your margins
        and you have little control over last-mile delivery
        which can affect the quality of the food and put your
        reputation at risk. One way to counter this is to offer
        your own delivery service, but this comes with higher
        marketing costs and logistical complications.

        All You Need To Know About How To Open A Cloud Kitchen
        In India
      </h2>
      <p>
        In this article, we will take you through the
        investments, licenses required, type of location, and
        everything else you need to know about how to open your
        very own cloud kitchen.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        1. Deciding The Location Of The Cloud Kitchen Restaurant
      </h3>
      <p>
        The primary reason behind the low investment needed to
        open a cloud kitchen is the real estate cost. Location
        is the biggest differentiator that reduces the cost of
        opening a cloud kitchen as compared to a traditional
        dine-in restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          In the cloud kitchen model, the location doesn’t have
          to do anything with footfalls, parking space, and
          high-end sites. However, it does have a lot to do with
          proper sanitation and water supply with low rentals.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the location should be chosen based on the
        customer demography and the type of food product that
        you are selling. The cloud kitchen should be located
        where there is a high demand for the food that you’d be
        offering. For instance
        <br /> This article will tell you how to decide the best
        location for opening your cloud kitchen business.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>2. Implementing The Online Food Ordering</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have decided on the location, you need to
        decide on the technology to accept orders. There are
        many online ordering and delivery platforms such as
        Swiggy, Zomato, Foodpanda, etc. that accept online
        orders on your behalf and also deliver the food to your
        customers. These companies usually charge 18-30% of your
        revenue per order. There is also a one-time integration
        fee involved for some FoodTech companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          Since a cloud kitchen relies solely on its online
          presence to draw in customers, a website with the
          option to order food online is an absolute must.
        </b>
        Various website developers can build a well-optimized
        website for you. However, you can also go for the
        services provided at POSist, which also gets integrated
        with your POS software, which further increases your
        efficiency in taking orders and managing customers.
        Also, customers can track their orders on a real-time
        basis.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>3. Acquiring The Licenses For The Online Kitchens</h3>
      <p>
        Licensing is an integral part of setting up a
        restaurant. Few licenses are essential to procure in the
        first month of operations for a hassle-free business.
        <b>
          These are FSSAI licenses, GST Registration, Municipal
          health trade licenses, fire licenses, etc.
        </b>
        It is advised to hire an agency to apply for all the
        permits because it is the most tedious and
        time-consuming task. Apart from this rest of the permits
        would cost you around Rs 10,000 (if the FSSAI license is
        applied for one year) Here is a complete list of all the
        permissions required for opening a food business in
        India and the steps to procuring them.
      </p>

        4. Kitchen Equipment, Raw Materials, And Packaging
        Needed For A Cloud Kitchen
      </h3>
      <p>
        The cost of setting up the kitchen will vary depending
        on the cuisine and food you are offering. For example,
        the cost of setting up a cloud kitchen that wants to
        serve items like Burger, Pizza, Pasta, and Sandwiches
        will not cost more than Rs 2,00,000.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>
          If you spend wisely on equipment by procuring new
          electronic items and old equipment such as tables,
          racks, and storing shelves, you can save up a lot of
          money.
        </b>
        The cost can go up because of the heavy equipment like a
        chimney, deep refrigerators, and burners. If you are
        planning to run multiple brands from the same kitchen,
        you can leverage the same kitchen equipment and
        resources for multiple brands. This would help you save
        on the equipment cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is how you can choose the kitchen equipment for
        your cloud kitchen
      </p>
      <p>
        Raw materials required to start the cloud kitchen
        operations depend on the type of food you’re offering.
        It is important to choose the right vendors at this
        stage for the raw materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should allocate an extra budget for packaging as it
        plays a crucial role in creating a brand recall for the
        customers. The packaging must be sturdy to preserve the
        quality of the food during the delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since you are no longer able to provide a physical guest
        experience, packaging should leave a good impression on
        the minds of the customers. Ensure that the packaging
        contains your restaurant’s logo and reflects the theme
        and concept of your restaurant.

        5. Staff Requirement In A Cloud Kitchen Restaurant
      </h3>
      <p>
        The secret sauce behind a successful restaurant is the
        team that works for it, with the Chef being the most
        critical part of the team, as they not only prepare the
        food but also help in designing the menu.
        <b>
          In an online kitchen, a minimum of five employees is
          required.
        </b>
        You’d need at least two chefs, two helpers, and one
        housekeeper. The salary of the staff depends on their
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average salary of the Chef at Commis level 1 is Rs
        14000- Rs 15000, while that of helpers and other staff
        salary ranges between Rs 6000- Rs 8000 based on their
        work. Apart from the kitchen staff, two employees at the
        delivery and one at the counter for receiving online and
        telephonic orders are required. Here we would also like
        to recommend you to partner with the third-party
        delivery services which work on a per-order basis.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>6. Staff Uniform For Cloud Kitchen Employees</h3>
      <p>
        For a cloud kitchen, one may feel that a staff uniform
        is not required. However, it is still heavily
        recommended to have a dress code for maintaining
        discipline, cleanliness, and hygiene.
        <b>
          Also, provide your cloud kitchen staff with essential
          hygiene and safety standards equipment such as masks,
          hair caps, and gloves.

      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        7. Point Of Sale Technology Needed For A Cloud Kitchen
      </h3>
      <p>
        The entire online food ordering and delivery system is
        heavily dependent on the proper acceptance of food
        orders.
        <b>
          It is also essential to keep track of the number of
          orders incoming from the various online ordering
          platforms. Tracking of orders and detailed reporting
          is essential for the smooth functioning of
          restaurants.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Select a POS that is customized to suit the requirements
        of the online ordering website. The one we recommend is
        our very own POSist software, which is
        hardware-independent and completely browser-based. You
        can use any web-enabled device such as a computer,
        laptop, tablet, or even your mobile to generate the
        bills.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>8. Mobile Phones And Other Miscellaneous Items</h3>
      <p>
        <b>
          An online kitchen requires a board line, mobile
          phones, high-speed internet, stationery, small
          counters, and chairs.

      <h3>9. Marketing Required For A Cloud Kitchen</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="/industries-we-serve/cloud-kitchen-marketing-agency/">Proper marketing and advertising</a> are
        essential to the success of a restaurant. For a cloud
        kitchen, marketing becomes even more necessary as it
        becomes the single source of getting orders. Since you
        are not spending on location and other maintenance
        costs, you can keep a sum aside for marketing.
        <b>
          Online marketing works in favor of cloud kitchens
          quite well.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing you need to do is to get your restaurant
        registered on restaurant listing and review sites such
        as Zomato, Tripadvisor, Burrp, etc., and encourage
        positive reviews from your regulars. You can also try
        Facebook for advertising exclusive deals and discounts.

      A website is a must if you own a restaurant and want to
      create a digital identity for your business. A website is
      important to interact with customers and attract potential
      customers through the website. Therefore, the website for
      any restaurant needs to be interactive. However, there are
      so many different website platforms that it becomes

      and people are usually confused between the two. Both
      types of websites have their advantage, but which is best
      for a restaurant? Let’s find out.
    </p>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Restaurant website based on HTML</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is one of the most basic ways to create a website,
        but it can be customized to your favorite design through
        CSS. A restaurant website based on HTML will come with
        the most simple-to-use user interface, where you can
        easily provide textual, video, and image forms of
        information to the viewers. If you want your customers
        to open the website and other pages on it with speed,
        then HTML is the best option. You can provide the
        details of your restaurant, images of the recipes, pages
        to introduce your team, and more.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />

      <h2>Pros</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to use and navigate for users</li>
        <li>
          Can easily integrate images, video, and text to show
          and describe various recipes and dishes
        </li>
        <li>
          Requires fewer server resources, so your website will
          open faster and will be up almost every time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Takes less time to develop, and the cost of creating
          an HTML website for a restaurant would less.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Cons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lack of many features like social media integration,
          animation, themes, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides a basic website that does not create an
          interactive experience for any restaurant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Does not allow a blogging engine, where the restaurant
          owner can easily interact with customers for feedback
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Restaurant website based on WordPress</h2>
      <p>
        WordPress is one of the most popular website platforms
        and is being used by some of the most popular
        restaurants in the world, such as Chez Panisse and
        Gotham Bar & Grill. With a WordPress website, you can do
        almost anything, limited only by the imagination of the
        restaurant owner. It is very easy to use and provides
        many features that increase the interaction with the
        potential customers of your

        <li>
          Restaurant owners can easily use tools and add things
          to websites like post press releases, announcements,
          or events immediately. Formatting and editing on a
          WordPress website are much easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is faster and includes all the features of HTML
          with additional website-building tools of WordPress.

        </li>
        <li>

          it easier for customers to locate the restaurant.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can integrate the social media components to
          interact with the customer online and in real-time.
        </li>
        <li>
          It also provides a reservation engine, which can be
          used to make reservations for restaurant tables
          online.
        </li>
        <li>
          Menus listed on the WordPress website can be easily
          edited and downloaded on users’ systems or phones.
        </li>

          It is SEO optimized, so promoting your restaurant

      <h2>Verdict</h2>
      <p>
        If you own a restaurant, a WordPress website makes a lot
        more sense as it allows you to interact with customers
        in multiple ways and guide them to your restaurant.
        Additionally, new plugins and features are regularly
        added to the platform, which helps to make the

      <h2>
        Why do you need a brand guide for hotels and
        restaurants?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Each business is different, but each requires a brand
        identity and image so that people can identify it across
        all channels, both physically and digitally. When we
        speak of the hotel industry, a brand guide plays a
        quintessential role in making your hotel different and
        appealing to tourists, visitors, and potential customers
        than others. If you don’t follow certain brand
        guidelines you will never be able to make a lasting
        impression in the market, nobody will recognize you, and
        nobody will remember it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>
        Let us understand the components of a brand guide with
        examples:
      </h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Brand voice</h2>
      <p>
        Brand voice is the message that the brand wants to
        deliver and establish in the market, especially in the
        eyes of the customers. A good example of a changing
        brand voice came from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company in
        2015 when they revealed a new logo and brand voice and
        promoted it across all channels to meet their guests.
        They made this change after 32 years.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <p>
        Take the example of any brand that you come across, you
        will find that there is a certain font, a type of
        structure they are following that not only makes them
        stand out from others but, at the same time, it offers
        them a new identity so much so that people instantly
        relate to a certain brand. You won’t believe it, but
        that’s how much the typography of a brand has ingrained
        into our minds.
        <br /> For example, to understand the logo and
        typography, let’s consider Park Hyatt, a sub-brand of
        the Hyatt Hotel Group. The typography is sleek and at
        the same time, it restores elegance in it. They use the
        serif font and the use of lines replicates strength.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Colour palette</h2>
      <p>
        When I say red you can immediately think of Zomato, when
        I say Swiggy you have an orange colour logo forming in
        your head, but it’s not even a typical orange but
        somewhere between red and yellow. Have you ever come
        across a brand that has multiple colour usage in its
        design, symbols, and logos? Go on, take a minute, think
        about it –<br /> You may not be able to think of any
        brand after I gave you the example of single-color
        brands, but actually, there are many, do you know what
        separates them? They are following a colour palette.
        <br /> Let alone if we Take the example of hotels, let’s
        talk about the Plaza Hotel in New York City, It has been
        a prominent location for many film shoots, The Plaza
        uses pink and its shades to add a touch of sweetness,
        and the hotel is known to use every shade of pink to
        replicate a feeling and spark a vibe for their guests.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Imagery</h2>
      <p>
        Pay attention, here we are not talking about a single
        picture that speaks for the brand, but all the visuals
        that come together to create brand imagery in a variety
        of ways. Now, these images can be used in multiple
        channels, from billboards to Instagram, in print ads on
        websites as well.
        <br /> When you are a hotel brand, such pictures can
        trigger your customers or a tourist to remember you and
        make a mental note of it, so the next time they are
        booking a hotel they will remember you. Remember, these
        are not random pictures but convey an emotion, most
        importantly the brand values. Many hotels use
        single-colour imagery because it retains sophistication
        and directly speaks to the eyes of potential customers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Tonality</h2>
      <p>
        Every hotel has a distinctive personality, for example,
        if you have to describe your hotel to a stranger for the
        first time, how will you do it? It is often suggested in
        hotel branding, that the owners must avoid using jargon
        and buzzwords.
        <br /> Your hotel’s persona should bring a specific
        image to mind. Having clarity can help you create good
        marketing creatives and copies, but not only that, it
        resembles one of the main brand guidelines.
        <br /> A subtle example of this would be the Aman –
        Luxury hotel, The hotel brand maximize the use of
        graphic images and only uses simple snippets but
        on-point information text, and again it is beautiful in
        its own way. The design sets the tone of the entire
        hotel chain.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Brand Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Like every individual has their way of doing things,
        this same formula applies to hotels and most importantly
        brands. So why certain brands do something and why they
        do it in a certain way replicates the brand philosophy,
        and that’s a pivotal part of the brand guide. People
        visiting your hotel must believe in its philosophy of
        doing things and how it caters to its customers.
        <br /> Another good example comes from the Ritz-Carlton
        hotels making an art form of guest service. They stated
        that a great service philosophy always empowers
        employees to demonstrate a higher degree of trust and
        work toward guest satisfaction.
        <br /> At last, we can easily conclude that a brand
        guide is a significant tool in marketing. If you are a
        hotel owner and also struggling to set brand guidelines
        to create an identity. Fielmente as a digital marketing
        agency specializing in the hotel industry will help you
        formulate your entire brand identity and create the most
        amazing brand guide which will not only appeal to your

  <p>As digital marketing is shifting rapidly, your hotel must use the best marketing concepts to drive new
    business. Online marketing through SEO, content, social media, paid campaigns, chatbots, and reputation management
    could greatly impact your hotel business. Oh, wait! Your website’s user experience is also important. But, don’t
    worry, Fielmente is here.</p>
  <p>To help you take your restaurant to the next level, we’ve suggested some creative ideas that would require little or
    no budget.</p>
  <p><b>Do a Q&A session with an industry expert at your hotel to drive marketing results.</b></p>
  <p>Create a Q&A or a podcast with an industry expert with a big social following. After the interview, post their
    responses on your social media, company’s blog, or newsletters.</p>
  <p>This type of content marketing works because the experts you interview might act as a brand preachers and bring
  their audience to you. Also, you can conduct live YouTube sessions and ask the audience to submit their questions for
  better engagement.</p>
  
  <br />
  <h2>Optimize your hotel’s website for voice search.</h2>
  <p>Event Planners and potential clients increasingly use voice search to get quick answers. So when you ask, “ Hey Siri,
    how many rooms are in the XYZ Hotel?” you need to make sure Siri knows the answer.</p>
  <p>But how?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Customize your SEO strategy and content so that modern speakers can easily tell the answers.</li>
    <li>Make the FAQs on your website as clear as possible so that search engines can find the answers properly.</li>
    <li>Find out the keywords your target consumers are searching for.</li>
    <li>Use alternative tags and descriptions on your images and all parts of your website to permit easy scanning and to
      occur through voice search.</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <h2>Create hotel ambassadors.</h2>
  
  <p>Sometimes a simple marketing idea for hotels comes from a simple hack. So reach out to your hotel employees and get
    this strategy done.</p>
  <p><b>Let them post on social media.</b></p>
  <p>Choose an in-house ambassador to reach people, interact with potential customers, and share unique thoughts about
    your
    business. This will help solidify the brand value more. These optimistic brand messages on social media will help
    build
    a well-known and respectable image.</p>
  <br />
  <h2>Create “blesuire” experiences at your hotel</h2>
  <p>What’s that? – Business + Leisure. Remember that event planners need to have meetings for business events, and your
    hotel’s services can help them achieve that.</p>
  <p>These days, travelers seek remarkable local experiences while on their business trips. Business travelers look
    forward
    to hotels that can host the program and offer special services like a gym, spa, sporting activities, social happy
    hours,
    and other luxuries. A taste of regional culture, great food, and eye-catching sights don’t hurt either.</p>
  <br />
  <h3>Offer upgrades to business travelers.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Extravagance amenities</li>
    <li>Free ride to a major convention</li>
    <li>A free beverage at the hotel bar or restaurant</li>
    <li>Tickets to reservations at high-end restaurants</li>
    <li>Access to a local music venue</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>An add-on or upgrade can close the deal for guests. Weave in tailored add-ons like these when clients go to
    book:</p>
  <br />
  <h2>Post testimonials and reviews on your hotel’s website.</h2>
  <p>Your possible clients will read the feedback no matter what, so you might as well place them on your social
    media! You can ask past guests for custom reviews, or you can take the quotes from review sites like
    TripAdvisor.</p>

      statement for yourself.</p>
    <p>For example, your company is planning to roll out a new range of products by 2022. Your objective statement could
      be: “To launch a new range of products to increase the revenue from this segment by 30% in 2022”.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>3. Develop a Target Audience Profile</h2>
    <p>A lot of work goes into developing a target audience profile. The reason behind developing a target audience
      profile is to ensure that your marketing strategy is successful, and you are able to target the right audience for
      each product or service that you develop in the future.</p>
    <p>A target audience profile can be developed in many ways. One way is to look at the characteristics of a person who
      bought a product or service in the past and find out if they are likely to buy that product or service again.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>4. Determine the Market Share For Each Product or Service</h2>
    <p>Determine the market share for each of your products or services so that you have a true indication of the sales
      potential of each product or service.</p>
    <p>For example, take a look at your company’s current market share for each product. It might be:</p>
    <p>Revenue (Current Market Share) = $100 million</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>5. Identify The Distribution Channel That Will Provide The Potential Customers For Your Business In 2022</h2>
    <p>Depending on the characteristics of your target demographic, identify the distribution channel that would cater to
      their needs by providing them with a variety of products and services.</p>
    <p>You have to decide whether you want to sell your products and services directly or whether you want to sell through
      distributors and retailers.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>6. Identify The Consumer Buying Behavior For Each Product or Service</h2>
    <p>Once you identify who your target demographic is, look at the consumer buying behavior of your target audience in
      order to understand their needs and common purchasing factors.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>7. Analyze Competitors in Your Market Research</h2>
    <p>In order to look at all opportunities for improvement, it’s important for you to take a close look at the
      competitors in your market research so that you are able to identify what strategies have worked for them and what
      strategies could possibly work for your business as well.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>8. Develop a Marketing Plan That Is Unique To You</h2>
    <p>Every company or entrepreneur is unique in some way. So, it’s important for you to develop a marketing plan that is
      unique to you and your business so that you are able to showcase your strengths, build on your weaknesses, and
      create opportunities.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Final words</h2>
    <p>Planning your marketing strategy in 2022 is just the starting point. You have to <b>implement the food and beverage
        marketing plan</b> that you came up with during this planning process by 2022.</p>
    <p>It’s important for you to remember that there is a lot more that goes into creating a successful marketing plan for
      your business than just developing a marketing strategy in 2022. Planning your marketing strategy in 2022 means that
      you have identified what <b>beverage marketing strategy</b> would work best for your business and how the
      opportunity can be improved if necessary.</p>

    description:

  <p>Businesses are always on the lookout for new strategies they can use to get ahead of the competition. Search engine
    optimization, commonly abbreviated as SEO, is one of those strategies that can be used by small businesses to create a
    name for themselves online. If you’re not sure how SEO for local restaurants could be helpful, here are just a few of
    the ways that SEO for restaurants could help build your brand.</p>
  <h2>1. SEO Helps Boost Profits</h2>
  <p>Small business owners tend to only pay attention to their bottom line, so when you see them attribute Google search
    engine results to an increase in sales, you can be sure that this is because of SEO. However, SEO doesn’t just help
    your bottom line — it’s also a great way to build the reputation of your small business online.</p>
  
  <p>Other Local Businesses: Whether or not your local restaurant is a startup or well-established, chances are that they
    could benefit greatly from using Google and other search engines too (and you should consider building up their
    profile on GMB as well).</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>2. SEO helps boost traffic to your restaurant</h2>
  <p>Search engine optimization can also help drive traffic to your restaurant’s website and encourage consumers to visit
    frequently. When potential customers start searching for your business using phrases such as “Best restaurants near
    me” or “best local restaurants” — they’ll most likely see what they’re looking for on Google locator’s search results
    pages, with a map of the area and ratings and reviews of nearby restaurants.</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>3. SEO helps generate more leads</h2>
  <p>When people type keywords into a search engine related to your business, you have the chance to capture their
    information. In addition, simply being visible in the Google results will increase your chances of collecting more
    leads.</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>4. SEO helps provide your restaurant with more exposure to social media</h2>
  <p>One of the ways that you can use SEO to boost your online presence is by making sure that you have a presence on as
    many social media platforms as possible. This will help you ensure that any Google searches related to your business,
    either by name or other relevant keywords, will turn up results that include your social media and website listings.
  </p>
  
  <p>The extra exposure can generate leads and interest in your restaurant and its menu which can also lead to more
    frequent visits from customers (and potentially new customers). If they like what they see online, they’ll check out
    the reviews and get more information about the businesses through Google and other search engines.</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>5. SEO helps lay the groundwork for long-term success</h2>
  <p>The only way SEO can generate traffic to your restaurant is if your website has a high ranking in the search engines.
    This means, that even if you can’t see results right away, you have to be careful about keyword density, content, and
    other factors that help boost your ranking so that you get more traffic over the long term. That’s why it’s best to
    hire a professional who can provide your local business with everything they need to build their online presence.</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>6. SEO helps build your restaurant’s brand</h2>
  <p>Ultimately, SEO is all about creating an online presence for your business. If you want potential customers to know
    more about you and check out your website, you need to pay attention to what keywords you’re using on your website.
    But once you have a presence in the search engines, it’s important to make sure that it’s easy for people to find what
    they’re looking for online.</p>
  
  <p>If most of your content is related to the products and services you provide (and include original photos of using
    those products), that will help people find what they’re looking for more quickly so that they can come in and try out
    your food.</p>
  
  <br />
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>SEO can help you build your restaurant to be more successful and grow your business, so don’t hesitate to leave us a
    comment if you have any questions.</p>`,

    <p>Being a restaurant owner is exciting, challenging, and requires lots of work. Can you see yourself, lunch rush
      accompanying you as usual, with all the food orders coming in? Or are you looking to take on the challenge of
      performance marketing? The chances are high that if you have even thought about launching a new concept or selling
      your restaurant’s services to different venues, performance marketing is one of the ways.</p>
    <p>Searching for a performance marketing company?</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Here are 6 steps to do performance marketing for restaurants.</h2>
  </div>
  <br />
  
  <div>
    <h2>1) Learn what works:</h2>
    <p>What do you really need to know when getting started?</p>
  
    <p>What is the right place to start with performance marketing? Perhaps your competitors are already doing it, and
      they have been able to take advantage of the changing times.</p>
  
    <p>If this is the case, you can choose not to bother yourself. However, if you wish to make things work for yourself,
      then it would be great if you know what works for your competition in terms of generating traffic and sales.</p>
  
    <p>You would want to understand the way or the ways that make their model successful. You should also learn where they
      are spending most of their resources; things like search engine marketing (SEM), social media, pay-per-click (PPC)
      advertising campaigns, etc.</p>
  </div><br />
  <div>
    <h2>2) Diversify:</h2>
    <p>If you are still considering performance marketing as a new, exciting proposition in the face of what is already
      established and working for your competitors.</p>
  
    <p>But if you have decided to do it anyway, then you should choose a different approach. If your competitors are
      utilizing everything from those mentioned above to their advantage, then there is no point in trying to perform the
      exact same way.</p>
  
    <p>Instead of that, why not take a more holistic approach? Focus on generating traffic and sales from both organic
      search traffic and paid advertising campaigns while taking into account social media. Then when all these are done,
      focus on conversion rate optimization (CRO) and learn how to brand yourself among your target audience.</p>
  </div><br />
  
  
  <div>
    <h2>) Budget:</h2>
    <p>How much can you really afford to do? In most cases, the answer is always: it depends. What is more important is to
      get a realistic figure in mind first. That will help you decide what kind of budget you can actually afford and
      where you should put it.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>4) Identify your target market:</h2>
    <p>This would be an aspect that needs to be carefully done for every performance marketing campaign. Why just leave
      the possibilities to run wild?</p>
  
    <p>It would be great being able to know exactly how many people are likely to come from each area when looking at the
      demographic data of your location. If your target audience is potential customers from surrounding areas and
      regions, then it would be best if you ran advertisements in those areas as well.</p>
  
    <p>If however you just want to focus on the same sets of people that go to your location, then it would be better if
      you consider doing store advertising as well.</p>
  </div><br />
  
  
  <div>
    <h2>5) Define your objectives:</h2>
    <p>Once you have decided how to create and run performance marketing for restaurant campaigns, it’s time to figure out
      what you would want it to achieve.</p>
  
    <p>There are some common objectives for which companies do performance marketing. These may include anything from
      generating sales and traffic, getting leads, managing foot traffic, and closing sales.</p>
  
    <p>Different types of campaigns will be needed for each objective. It is best being able to know exactly what kind of
      campaign would work best for your purpose and initial goals.</p>
  </div><br />
  <div>
    <h2>6) Continuously Creating Content:</h2>
    <p>Nowadays, it has always been advised to create and post fresh and unique content to increase the visibility of
      commercial websites. This method is not only applicable to website owners but can also be used by restaurants for
      promotional purposes.</p>
  
    <p>You should have a constant flow of new content or articles ready to be posted on your social media platforms such
      as Facebook and Twitter. Be sure to always use full image descriptions too while posting. Your customers will
      appreciate the extra information as they read through your posts, some of them may also make bookings or get
      interested in what you have so much available in store.</p>
  </div><br />
  <div>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>If you are still thinking about what to do as your first step in terms of performance marketing for restaurants,
      then this article should answer all your questions. After doing a little bit of research on what has been working
      for others, you will be able to establish how you would want to start, where to put your budget, and when or when
      not to go for each type of campaign.</p>
  
    <p>You might have the right idea but it may take some time and effort before you get the results that match your
      expectations.</p>

    <p>Unless you have been living under a rock, the name MetaVerse might sound a bit familiar to you. Everyone everywhere
      is talking about it. There have been discussions and debates around this topic. But what really is MetaVerse?</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>What is MetaVerse?</h2>
    <p>Well simply put into words, MetaVerse is basically a three-dimensional network of virtual reality worlds that only
      exists within the walls of reality headsets. It’s incredibly futuristic and something you see in science fiction
      novels and movies. But now as the human species is rapidly evolving and advancing its technology at a much faster
      rate, a “virtual life” is very much becoming the new hot topic considering how possible all of it looks now. Meta,
      formerly known as Facebook, has recently launched its Oculus VR Series which is one of the most advanced virtual
      reality headsets ever created.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>What can You do in MetaVerse?</h2>
    <p>You can do anything that doesn’t necessarily require your physical presence. You can play games with friends and
      hang out in a comedy club afterward in the form of avatars. You can go to places that exist in a particular
      augmented reality (AR) which is just a computerized representation of the real world and just roam around and enjoy
      passing your time. You can also go to know places that do not exist and have a good time like in the case of several
      Virtual Reality where you can grab the rest of your gear and smash fruits with your virtual sword.</p>
  
    <p>But the real reason why we are here right now is to discuss the effect the MetaVerse will have on the food and
      beverage industry. How will restaurants and cafés work in such an environment? Well, we are here to help you break
      it down and make you understand the A to Z on this concern.</p>
  
    <p>But before that, we would like to talk about NFTs which is another one of the trending topics right now. To briefly
      understand non-fungible tokens, you will need to understand a form of currency exchange that is not really equal in
      value. 15 coins can be traded for 15 coins because they possess the same value. However, every NFT is unique and
      can’t be equaled by a value.</p>
  
    <p>Now, moving on to ……</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>The Effect of MetaVerse on the Food and Beverage Industry</h2>
    <p>People are investing millions of dollars into the metaverse to acquire digital property. A lot of digital real
      estate is for sale now in the metaverse and investors are constantly trying to clasp the best deals. In the same
      way, the big names in the food and beverage industry are trying to come up with creative ways to invest in the food
      market of the metaverse. There have been talks of even exchanging real food for NFTs.</p>
  
    <p>Imagine you are in the metaverse, and you acquire the NFTs to an XYZ restaurant through a game or by any other
      means, you could even end up exchanging that token for a real meal from the XYZ restaurant in the real world. All of
      this sounds exciting and confusing at the same time, doesn’t it?</p>
  
    <p>We completely understand! MetaVerse is still in this very fetal stage and it will take a while before we start
      going into virtual restaurants with our friends and families as Avatars but a business needs to be prepared for the
      opportunity when it drops by.</p>
  
    <p>But you shouldn’t be waiting for the expansion of MetaVerse in order to market your food and beverage business and
      should start now. If the marketing side of the business has a habit of overwhelming you, don’t worry about it, and
      go to <a href='/'>www.fielmente.com</a> to book your free hospitality marketing consulting now!</p>

    <p>Marketing in the restaurant industry is challenging. There are so many different jobs to do, so many aspects of
      customer service, and so many ways to do things wrong.</p>
    <p>But when done the right way, marketing in restaurants can result in much happier customers and much higher profits
      for everyone involved! This is why we’ve created this handy list of 7 <b>restaurant marketing strategies in
        India</b> that will help you keep your customers happy while you grow your business.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Best 7 Restaurant Marketing Strategies in India</h2>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>1) Listen To Your Customers: </h2>
    <p>The only way to know what works best for your restaurant is to listen to your customers. Your menu, the way you
      serve dishes, and even the design of your restaurant can all be improved by listening.</p>
    <p>Consider how many restaurants have outside seating during the summer. Not too many. But they do have a great deal
      of business in that section of their restaurant! Now consider how many restaurants have inside seating on a hot
      summer day and barely any business. Not too many. That is the power of hearing what customers want. Don’t try to be
      everything for everyone.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>2) Provide Something Different:</h2>
    <p>Regardless of what you eat, people need something to make them stop and do something different. Sometimes people
      just like to sit around and talk, and if you have seating for that, people will be much more likely to stop in for a
      bite to eat.</p>
    <p>This applies elsewhere in the restaurant as well. If you have an area where people can get outside and play games,
      or just sit and relax, then even more people will be inclined to come in for a bite to eat.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>3) Offer Complimentary Items:</h2>
    <p>The best way to make a customer happy is to give them something for free in appreciation for their business. There
      is nothing wrong with surprising your customers with a complimentary appetizer, dessert, or even drink.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>4) Have A Unique Menu:</h2>
    <p>Your menu should be different and unique. If you are not offering something that people cannot get anywhere else,
      then you may as well not have much of a restaurant at all.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>5) Send Out Loyalty Cards or Discounts: </h2>
    <p>Loyalty programs are incredibly common, which is why they work so well. But the best loyalty program you can have
      is one where you send out cards or discounts to your customers that let them know how much you appreciate their
      business.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>6) Maintain Quality Systems (i.e. HACCP): </h2>
    <p>Having a clean restaurant is important, but having a clean restaurant that is free of contaminants is even more
      important. Food safety is one of the most vital parts of doing business in the hospitality industry and it has been
      proven time and time again that it can be an incredibly successful strategy for restaurants.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>7) Check-In on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter:</h2>
    <p>One of the most effective ways that businesses can stay up to date is by being on social media. Not only will you
      be able to know what is going on with your customers, but you could also build a loyal following in the process.</p>
    <p>Make sure that your brand is represented correctly and in an appealing way, and set a good example for your
      customers. This can create a strong bond between your restaurant and its customers, which will result in better
      business down the road.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h2>Final words</h2>
    <p>This is not an exhaustive list of marketing strategies. This list was created to be complementary to the knowledge
      you already have and are familiar with. If you have a different marketing strategy that has helped you, or know that

  <p>We personally believe that the first step towards success lies in building a strong brand. The journey may be a bit
    tiresome and time-consuming but do not lose hope – we’re here with you to guide you till the end.</p>
  <p>We have been there when it was very tough to stand out against our competitors and slowly, with years of effort and
    hard work, we have made our mark in the market as one of the most admired names out there! ????</p>
  <p>We assisted The Asian Wok to set up its cloud kitchen in Kolkata, did their social media, provided them with
    consultation, helped them with menu and signage designing, and viola – they’re doing amazing today! Check out the pdf
    below and let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!</p>
  <p>Get in touch with us today for a free consultation and let’s create some magic together! When we first started with
    Fielmente, people often told us, “What’s so special about it? There are already loads of agencies doing exactly the
    same!”</p>
  <p>And we cannot find a better day than today to reply to that!</p>
  <p>One of the most valuable clients of Fielmente, ‘The Asian Wok” has spread its wings with loads of new customers and
    orders incoming every day!</p>
  <p>What did Fielmente do?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>We helped them start from scratch and helped them create an effective roadmap.</li>
    <li>We did their branding – designed their logo, made a color pallet, and designed intriguing menu options for them.
    </li>
    <li>Then we hopped on social media – we helped them to build a strong online presence through organic postings and ads
      and created various offers and deals to attract more and more orders.</li>
    <li>Later on, we also designed their signage boards for a bit of offline marketing and it started to work like a
      wonder!</li>
    <li>Our team provided them with 24/7 consultation to assist them whenever they got stuck at any place, at any time.
    </li>
    <li>We helped them set up the whole Cloud Kitchen restaurant in Kolkata and guided them to deliver proper orders with
      proper packaging on time.</li>
  
  </ol>
  <p>And there it is – they’re doing more than great today! Fielmente doesn’t just take up orders and complete them – we
    stand by our clients from start to end until they become highly profitable and well-branded!</p>
  <p>We want to thank our clients for giving us this opportunity to prove our potential to them and a big kudos to team
    Fielmente for excellent coordination and all the hard work!</p>

    <p>Through exclusive groups and broadcast listing, small enterprises sell their offerings to their specific clients to
      create strong interactions with them. On the other hand, medium-sized and big businesses utilize the new premium
      WhatsApp Business API to enjoy their consumers by providing them with information about their purchases, receiving
      customer feedback, and even frequent updates.<br /> WhatsApp can be a really good way to directly connect with your
      consumers. There is nothing special you can do in this, it is just that you will be reaching each one of consumers,
      directly to them, unlike social media platforms.</p>
    <p>WhatsApp enables brands to establish a business page on the app, which is similar to Facebook. Your profile will
      provide customers with crucial information like location, description, website, and contact information. A catalog
      may
      also be added.<br />
      You may contact consumers directly if you utilize WhatsApp Business. You may also automate messages with a chatbot
      so
      that your viewers can respond fast to their inquiries.</p>

    <h2>Tips on how to increase engagement</h2>
    <ul>

        the limit for retweets and comments at least 20 characters.</li>
      <li>Facebook’s algorithm favors short text postings, which implies that they appear more frequently. However, the
        algorithm can change and you will have the ability to influence your audience’s interaction with Facebook posts
        with less language.</li>
      <li>Remember: You publish your brand, so publish true “insider” pictures at greater engagement rates.</li>
    </ul>

      of Management the effect on Indian Hotel Business by Dr Jasveen Kaur and Jobanjeet Kaur – Assessing the Impact of
      Corona Virus (COVID-19) on Tourism and Hospitality Industry in India- a Perspective Study stated that the occupancy

      tourism industry leading to uncertainty and fear among all stakeholders. </p>

    <h2>Drop in the hotel occupancy rates</h2>
    <p>Hotel occupancy rates fell 20-40% while revenue per room for four-star hotels went down 65-70 %. The revenue for
      two-star hotels was also down by 50-60%. This negative impact on the hotel industry made us all think!</p>
  
    <p>According to <b>Smith Travel Research (STR) and Oxford Economics,</b> hotel revenue around the world dropped to
      half of what
      it was. The operating profit per available room dropped for the United States (down 122.8%), Asia-Pacific (down
      124.1%), Europe (down 131.9%), and the Middle East (down 124.1%).</p>
  
    <p>But the situation has changed for the better in 2023. Revenues are rising as people are traveling again. Though the
      danger of a lockdown has not completely faded these three years have given us a lot to learn.</p>

    <h2>Strategies for Hotel Business to Overcome Emergencies and Achieve Success in New Normal</h2>
    <img src="/images/blog/last-2nd-bg.png" alt="hero" />
    <br />
    <h2>Management- Improve your hotel business in the new normal</h2>
    <p>The hotel business has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, but there are things that <b>hotel managers can</b>
      do to
      adapt to the new normal and <b>achieve success.</b></p>
  
    <p>First and foremost <b>devise an emergency management plan.</b> This plan should cover all scenarios related to
      emergencies
      including natural disasters, pandemics, and security threats.</p>
  
    <p><b>Create a safe and healthy environment for your guests and staff.</b> The cleaning and sanitizing procedures must
      be
      followed strictly. Also, maintain a healthy supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff.</p>
  
    <p>Establish a <b>connection with travel agents as they are a valuable source of bookings</b> for hotels. Even during
      the
      off-season travel agents can increase your visibility to potential guests and generate more reservations.</p>
  
    <p><b>Monitor your guest’s travel history to ensure their safety.</b> It will help you to properly sanitize the rooms
      and take
      preventive measures if needed.</p>
  
    <p><b>Implement low-season strategies.</b> It is often very difficult to maintain a steady occupancy rate during low
      season, so
      come up with strategies for the same. Even during the off-season, there are things you can do to increase hotel
      occupancy and generate revenue. Like,</p>
  
    <p>– <b>Offer competitive rates and discounts</b> to attract budget-minded travelers.
  
    <p>– <b>Offer package deals</b> that include accommodation, meals, activities, or other amenities that your hotel can
      provide.
  
    <p>– <b>Run promotions for large groups</b> of families or business travelers.
  
    <p>– <b>Host events</b> such as conferences, expos, weddings, holiday parties, flea markets or music festivals.
  
    <p>– You can also <b>target specific markets</b> such as business travelers, families or couples.
      <img src="/images/blog/last-2nd-bg2.png" alt="hero">
  
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Staff Training for Improved Hotel Business</h2>
    <p>As any hotel owner would agree, our <b>staff is the face of the hotel.</b> Their interactions with a guest can make
      or
      break experiences. That is why training the staff is crucial.</p>
    <br />
    <p><b>– Provide ample training</b> to the staff in safety and security procedures.</p>
  
    <p>– Teach the staff to interact and inform them <b>how to handle guests in case of threats.</b></p>
  
    <p>– Train the staff <b>how to use new technology</b> like a mobile app or check-in systems.</p>
  
    <p><b>– Empower staff</b> to make decisions and actions. This will build the trust and faith of customers in your
      service.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Technology for improved hotel business</h2>
    <p>Post-pandemic era is all about good technology. Being in the industry we are seeing a steady rise in new
      technological implementations.</p>
    <p>A few of them are:</p>
    <p>– Mobile App for Booking and Tracking</p>
  
    <p>– Mobile App for Food Delivery</p>
  
    <p>– Software for training and work-from-home</p>
  
    <p>– Robots for Cleaning and Guest’s Services</p>
  
    <p>– Sensors for contactless services</p>
  
    <p>– Resource Management apps</p>
    <p>Apart from these, a few more technological changes are required:</p>
    <p><b>– Using emails for email marketing</b></p>
    <p>Email marketing is one of the best ways to market. You have to prepare an email list of your past guests and
      potential guests. Send them emails about your offers, coupons and other important dates.</p>
    <p><b>– Build an online reputation</b></p>
    <p>Focus on your reviews and ratings. Make sure the brand identity is maintained. It builds trust and reputation. This
      has long-term benefits as well. Reviews and ratings help bring new guests. So answer any questions or respond to
      queries online.</p>
    <p>– Get registered on meta-search engines like Trivago and TripAdvisor. This will boost your visibility and
      reputation. This will also increase your reach to potential guests.</p>
    <p><b>– Start a social media page</b></p>
    <p>The pandemic has drastically increased social media users. So, make use of it. Social media posts by guests will
      also <b>increase your brand’s exposure.</b> Facebook and Instagram are good operations. You can also try Pinterest.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>– SEO Optimize your hotel’s website </p>
    <p>It will help to <b>gain visibility on search engines</b> like Google and Yahoo. The results are long-term and if
      executed
      properly will skyrocket your revenue in a few months.</p>
